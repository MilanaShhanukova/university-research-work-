and young people spend more time on their lifestyles 
in this society those who will not study will never grasp the concepts or understand any ideas which is the most important point thus i am also very interested and prefer to have the study materials 
this is a serious problem but most people are unaware of it 
students can focus on only a few subjects they are interested in and they will become experts in those areas 
but in another way this means the country needs to pay extra money to build and repair the roads what they did is reduce the amount of gas consumed raise the gas tax and lower the income tax because they thought only raising the gas tax is unfair

i will explain my point of view in the following paragraphs 
he thinks differently than others and he has succeeded 
these activities make the community a better place to live and include those values in all the members 
all the broad knowledge helps them to understand their major in university classes as well as help them to make a correct choice in a specialized area 
i could very easily understand why he would always bring bad marks home 
then when we went to the science olympiad she had diverse knowledge about the subjects and it was not new for her to think about new things 
if every person tries to learn and understand lots of scientific subjects no person will do it and as a result of this no science will be improved 
thus i agree wholeheartedly with the above in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today 
third put it in the front of the door of the store so people see it even if it is not good 
however are these things good to all people 
they will run out very soon at the current rate of utilization 
in the lecture however the professor opposed reading the statement 
you have to create these opportunities

he or she wants to know everything about the universe god and death these are some concepts that everyone can encourage ideas but no facts have been found yet 
it so expensive that only those people can do this factoring in their daily living expenses 
they make very high profits year after year and the numbers also increase year after year

second the amount of treasure locations is implausibly large

it kept anasazi from living in the american southwest with very high temperatures and caused droughts

this is how we are transforming our society in the present day the consequence of disagreeing with this statement is that we are looking at what we want in the moment in order to have a great time 
not only this but without a clear understanding of what is being taught the student would not be able to perform well on the tests

although the few lucky ones struck gold most of the people simply vanished as they left their homes only to be forgotten and some of them even developed obsessions for the western mirage

its cost is half than the other but its life cycle is the same 
what we do now we can do later 
according to me there are two kind of studies the highly technical ones and the others 
thus we begin to share information and ask our own questions about a weaker subject 
for example in the 2 0 0 6 world cup form germany many coaches on a team work 
many scientists obtained clear results of investigations after the facts were on the table but before they could even begin to theorize about them 
this will give rise to holistic understanding 
they want to make people understand that their product is the best and you can really trust it 
there can be many other theories about the reasons for and methods of migration 
thus the environmental issue will encourage more people to consider ways to commute other than driving a car

they tend to restrict traffic on certain days and hours and increase parking fees etc 
for instance we can consider that evolution exists 
so depending on the study it would be better one way or the other since the thing is to choose the right one 
i am really sorry to continue this way but right now i am taking the test in a room with five other people and we are all taking the test with computers 
in my opinion it is dependent on a particular person 
many people are killed by cars 
global warming and greenhouse effects have started recently 
examples if people who were good did something wrong they could develop into thieves robbers or criminals and make problems for other people 
for example when we talk about speed they must understand why it is dangerous it is better than if they have an accident and learn after that 
therefore people will be able to live with the automobile society and nature for the future

maybe at the beginning but time after time other animals in the environment will choose them as their new food 
the older man would prefer to enjoy all the time he has remembering that we live only once 
the scraping will cause heat and that heat energy will go into the car 
you will face huge difficulties in life if you do n t know at least something from every subject 
the younger generation is more adaptable and can therefore adapt to changing technology 
that is why i m here to be ready for my education that is to be specialized in one specific subject that i would like to learn in every detail 
furthermore the professor denies the reading passage which states that treasure does not exist and is just fiction

most people do n t care about the environment or how cars affect the ozone layer greatly

they have a broader spectrum of ideas that they can develop into competences throughout their student life

in this case a tour guide can be helpful to complete the trip in less time as compared to what one might end up spending if one decides to explore the place alone

it s very obvious that more cars will be sold there 
also a food chain becomes stronger than it was before such as rabbits and bears 
for older people the phone s only function in some ways is a job or project where a master will call on him to help with related jobs 
according to me in order to start the carrier through its success it s important to have a solid base that means knowledge and experience 
therefore i support the statement that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts 
yes that s right but there are some young people that think about the idealism of their country about their communities in indonesia about their friend who ca n t eat or go to school 
the time to take a risk can be validated by consulting with others who are more professional than i am in sorting out the issues or solving risky problems 
however after the recommended burning the forests can grow plentiful and farmers can get more work than before 
maybe doing what they already know how to do is better than to be annoyed with something new 
but in general lies do not last very long 
technology has grown so fast because everyone tries to work on an invention due to some ideas he developed and concepts that have been applied to this idea from different subject areas 
hence from the very beginning children form a hesitancy to interact with other people which time only solidifies 
he actually changed the way he played in the latter part of his career when he won all those championships 
we will continue to invent and produce more sophisticated technology based on our own comfort which will decrease our ability to perform physical activities 
facts are learned by experinces

this contradicts the passage that it is a bad influence to economics 
the purpose of traveling is using a lot of your time to release your mind is n t it 
the bass is not only a predator for menhaden so if people catch more bass the population of other fish will also grow 
today they are using this method as a curative measure but with increasing importance of preventative medicine normal healthy individuals are leaning towards not using cars whenever possible 
this shows that people are aware of the disadvantages of getting old and getting less pleasure from life and try to delay or disguise it in any possible way 
in fact we will need a lot of space to park all these cars so we need a project for this 
government uses that money for public use and safety 
second sphinx is known for an old kingdom king 
or is this the right thing to do 
i started to have an interest in math and spent a lot of time solving math problems and i got a good score on exams it makes me have more passion about math

it is more exciting and memorable 
the first clue is that there are rocks near the coast which are considered to be made by chinese explorers 
however his trying still brings him to success 
since i was in a group i should respect the group rules 
one good way to be safe and have a good time is to travel with a group and find a good tour guide 
i think that there is nothing i want in this tired city so why would father and mother want to visit it 
the lecturer went against the author s insistence for the following reasons 
in addition once he told me that he will never take the risk of doing other work because he has been working on this for 1 2 years and is already fluent at it 
for example the most famous inventor thomas edison was asked a question when he applied for a loan to a bank one more time for his experiments which were failing 
they behave as though they were just spontaneously praising a product during normal conversation

it usually makes them more positive to do it 
in both advertisements it is said that these tooth pastes will make your teeth brilliant and brighter 
we must trust ourselves 
that seems what people live for 
insufficient closet space inefficient heating and decaying plumbing makes life harder to live in old houses 
the advertisement says that the car has space for ten people when the truth is that the car just has space for four people another example is a skin soap advertisement that says the soap is the best because it will make your skin as soft as a 1 5 year old princess or as soft as the skin of jennifer lopez 
that means people that have something that is specialized in one subject could have a better chance of being hired 
and chimps can also remember what researchers said and almost perfect repeat what they said 
he will consider himself losing the years that he spent on collecting the money 
in addition the technology on which these mass transport systems function are based primarily on non conventional sources of energy 
first of all old houses are not necessarily suited to the needs of mordern residents 
of course it has the risk of failing but imagine the fantastic sensation of victory if his second bakery is as much as successful as the first one 
there are many people that do n t think before making a choice 
third although the passage claims they are dinosaurs because their bone structure is similar to endothermy scientist assume that it is not the case 
ten years ago a family that consists of five members owned at least two cars and that satisfied their transportation needs 
for example we can see on the discovery channel in the wild many people enjoy learning about the animals 
actual markets require more specific knowledge than broad knowledge 
only by breaking out of your normal life can you discover new perspectives in your job and your private life 
i said yes 
when you are successful you will have reasons to live 
the important thing is traveling without a tour guide 
fish firming uses the lots of special products such as fish meal 
lawyers are usually young people 
extending the same example as stated above i can tell you that during the worst period of amitabh bacchan he was offered a job in politics to take advantage of his publicity and would be paid heavily for it he was very much in need of financial support but mr bacchan rejected this offer because he knew how politicians play with the emotions of common people 
and when we want those energy sources we need to extract them from the ground and soil or oceans because those energy types are found in those places 
new plants could not grow after the fires 
people who are realistic can be more successful as we can see throughout history 
they are not stopping at the same time 
it means to understand war development you should understand the ideas and cultural movements that resulted in a particular period and helped for the occurring of that war for example 
in the commercials they are all good 
a different passage emphasizes an alternative to prescribed burning that uses the term disking a method that uses fire to clear out dry and dead shrubs thus stimulating the growth of new plant life 
this saved valuable time one can invest in more important activities 
but even if this student passes the course he she will not be a successful lawyer in the future about contracts 
in other words the variety of these towns might yield some changes that would encourage people who are interested in old things 
however there were n t any particles 
that shows that few animals could sustain and be active in this harsh and cold environment 
the way i see it the only thing that guides do is limit you and even more when you re in a group 
the facts were n t as important as the context 
these ideas and concepts usually contain academic researches that are totally reliable and dependent on the facts 
from this the professor agreed with some ideas and disagreed with some ideas 
but i went to jeju island more than three times 
i would have a variety of answers subjective to each person s field of interest 
the second one is to specialize in one specific subject one has his own test to study for so let us talk about this subject 
i think that the car twenty years from now will use electric fuel and not gasoline 
after this effort many companies in the world started actions to get this eco certified 
is it right 
any user who has used any toothpaste definitely knows that this can never be true 
after the construction of the first commercial car in 1 9 0 8 the ford t mankind has been subdued to the use of the car 
everybody loves him and he does as well 
successful people have gone through lots of hardship 
young people are still trying to obtain experience while older people have it already 
hence ideas and concepts are more reliable than the facts 
this has to do with the signs of our nature that we encounter nowadays 
for example drivers might memorize where the speed camera is located 
take toys for example advertisements that target children in particular are the best example of the way advertisements create a false image of the product 
the car was our answer to the needs of transportation sixty years ago and they will continue to be twenty more years from now 
they need cars for many things such as transportation entertainment and business 
because of the commitments men have to make to go to the army men have to sacrifice their precious time of youth 
if scientist will do something different like modifying the form of carbohydrate gelatinized and non gelatinized and then incorporating that into fish feed then fish may have a greater chance of growth and then be utilized more efficiently much to the appreciation of everyone 
while the results from both experiences are same the method and the time that brings a result is not the same 
because you do not need to be a hero in order to try new things you just need to want it and know that any result will be a success in things that you want or in learning 
they have to consider the negative side of their suggestion 
in such a situation there is no other way 
in the reach family all members have a car 
i held the map and tried to find all the famous points that it had marked on it 
even the magnitudes on mars are no evidence of life on mars 
for example when i traveled to france and italy alone i met a person in nice who was a famous producer of the song in taiwan 
finding oil and petrol and digging for it is a very expensive procedure 
i hope the things i learned will help me in the future 
for these reasons the passage said that it is time for the state to take measures to reduce the quantity of sulfur dioxide 
i think there must be many subjects better than just one subject 
also the animal population got better and recovered really well after the fire 
it provides a lot of wood to the industries 
some loose points in the wall 
the gas byproducts from cars will destroy the earth s environment and increase its temperature 
in writing we are nearly unable to express people s feelings but via action on tv we can understand these feelings better than from books 
these kind of fish ca n t live so long in water that contain salt 
everybody knows that today the truth of competitive markets in each and every field we re facing plenty of competition and if you are choosing a career in the field of software for example you have to master the subject and then you can easily get a job 
because you share only a single interest it makes you a loner 
in addition students want to learn the language and they want to use it so when they understand the concepts and the ideas it will help them to learn the language 
indeed they can be refused 
unfortunately we are individuals living isolated in society

an example that confirms or supports my point clearly is the chinese car 
furthermore it is way better to have knowledge than to guess and learn common facts that anyone could learn through the media 
it is the main resource that cars need to run 
from my personal experience when i was too busy to find the information the internet was a very useful and fast tool 
but then as it has been rightly said by someone we are the victims of our own greedy needs 
this is very useful for them 
but by then we have already bought the product and end up losing the money 
and we say that these countries are going to be the next developed countries 
my 1 0th exam and 1 2th exam are very good 
if they learn one thing they will learn another until they know how it works and what the useful aspects of it

also most people prefer to entertain athletics rather than the arts 
therefore he likes to do risky and strange things and he enjoys it 
but after a few days i found myself enjoying it 
however if they just work in the field which they already know how to do well they might feel sad and tired 
i believe to specialize in one specific subject outweighs having broad knowledge of many academic subjects 
in my opinion if someone thinks one is more important than the other why not focus on one 
and people feel more awkward when it comes to their ears that this is something that is a current event 
he would never want his business or company to be stagnant 
however i would prefer traveling by myself with good preparation and be filled with joy 
carbon dioxide is very harmful to people 
and i had to listen to success attracts success and money attracts money 
also they can go shopping and buy new fashionable clothes 
it s a really good film 
after that i studied the topic in more depth and understood the ideas and concepts of the topic 
when the forest is caught on fire the wood turns into ashes which is potassium

and it is important to have emotions in classes like history or social studies 
in old age people leave all their burdens behind and spend their time on work they re interested in 
every time when we meet i will look forward to the new things

as far as i am concerned i agree with this statement but some people may not agree with my opinion 
car usage in the united states is very important in every day life as well as in many latin american countries and third world countries 
however companies tend to cut their profits for workers 
many people are willing to buy these cars 
this one is the copper scroll 
another solution could be the developing of more fuel efficient cars which could also be good for american car manufacturers who will produce more attractive cars to sell to other countries 
consequently i agree with the statement for three reasons effect on one s view talking face to face with people and meeting for the first time 
first of all the population of the world is going down 
my wife and i always go to tokyo around december 
therefore the problem of running out of fuel is out of the question augumenting my view that the number of cars will continue to rise 
first effect is global warming 
so ho chi minh city will develop 
peolple like to drive different types of models and they want something extra in it 
these useful skills that i learned from reality are going to be the greatest gifts for my future career and they can not be found in textbooks anyway 
that s why i will not be as hard as when i am alone 
high cost produces high quality medicine 
this is an important thing 
books sometimes contain outdated information so they may be wrong 
to combat those problems people started to use cheaper transportation instead of cars 
however i agree that having knowledge is useful whenever we need necessary information 
but when the teacher asked me did i understand it i said yes 
so i disagree with the statement and i think it is much better to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects 
raising the gas tax could be the most effective way to decrease gas consumption for three reasons 
next kids are more attracted to the advertisements 
successful people can explain any other matter and discuss any other problem 
but it is dangerous because some drivers make trouble with other drivers and then the drivers crash their cars when the streets are busy 
because it is already fixed data nobody can create a problem with this type of literature 
also the professor indicates that we should be careful when we use the prescribed fire solution 
if they cannot pay the high prices anymore people have to start using a bus or a train 
this will reduce the pollution caused by cars releasing carbon dioxide 
moreover they have to learn about advanced course material 
sometimes age in my view is a barrier to some things in life 
in simple words they say they lost their appeal 
for example nursing students study in a nursing college for three to four years 
i believe that the product s quality mentioned in the shops is exactly the same as given in the ads 
then define your goals and work hard to achieve them 
critics of this policy focus on three points first yellowstone fires scorched a large area of land and a lot of plant species were lost 
in my past experiences there are some lectures which are completely based on facts and there is a slim chance for me to apply them 
when you understand the idea is one way you can figure out the statement that you see in the moment 
however a lot of reasons explain what the placebo effect does 
in today s world there is a high and almost undying thirst for change 
the kids can stay outside every day and play 
firstly i think that communities equal human relationships 
it may spoil the health also 
water is necessary to live 
i ve seen many times on tv the same people rich people who are interested in politics sports new technologies and also in space 
as a result studies in britain have shown that fluoride increases the activity that can lead to more bone density and therefore less bone fractures among the elderly 
also sometimes people may meet some new friends in the group they are traveling with 
if students just learn facts they would just forget them but this would not happen so easily if they understand properly the concepts behind the facts 
when i started completing my homework on time i gradually improved 
because if i study in this way i will gain so much and i also will have a lot of information from the books 
when you understand the concepts and ideas it is up to you to prove them to see if they are really what you have been told and i think this is the main reason why students prefer facts rather than just understanding ideas and concepts 
for example if you are attempting to study arts and sciences and are trying to get qualifications in both you are an extraordinary creation 
therefore as long as it is a country where i can understand their language i will travel alone 
the government will try to do something to not pollute the air 
so in this field it is very important to understand all the concepts and ideas they gave us and use them to solve problems 
because they sent out 2 0 of all carbon emissions 
in my opinion is so easy to understand one thing for example processes than to remember many divided facts or dates 
it is also necessary to take risks rather than just doing what you are supposed to 
no scientist would have ever come up with their wonderful inventions and the world would have never progressed 
there will be a technological development in the future but it will only promote the use of public transportation systems not personal cars 
not being with a guide gives you the liberty to visit the places you want to visit at your own pace and with the liberty to go anywhere you want to go 
usually in advertisements a presentable face is used to present a product such as a model a cute baby or a known face such as a sportsmen only to get the product to look better than it actually is 
not that bungee jumping is something that every young person wants to do but even if he wanted to do it he probably would n t be able to 
close up video clips of a juicy hamburger flying around the screen clearly satisfying the model eating it could easily create in viewers a false sense of being hungry and urge them to hop in a car and drive to a nearby fast food restaurant to buy what they saw 
so only time will tell what actually happens 
as we have all known when we were out something we ca n t expect would happen such as disease an accident or something else 
and then makers of cars need to develop the systems for safety almost completely 
third the professor agrees that the gas prices in the united states are cheap and they should raise them to save the environment and people s health 
nowadays there are many people who think they are the most important thing and they only have to work for themselves 
in general there are many people in the book 
but they do things in a different manner than others do which gives them success 
people feel more secure and comfortable to travel with their own car rather than travel using several public transportation vehicles to reach their destination far later than they would desire 
the second critique of this method is that the costumer loses all critical though and that he is not on guard 
as a result it will be easier for you to learn many things 
in short these were critical parts that contradicted the reading materials 
i think it s harder for a successful person to risk something becuase they could lose much more than others 
we can have a glance of what s happening in the world by accessing the internet using mobile devices also 
so the importance of communities in society decreased 
but found that successful people use money from other people and use their ideas for a way to success 
in my case when i did a job interview the employer asked me commonsense questions about society policy art and so on 
at some time they have to face their failures and struggles 
because it transmits eastern european habits to different places in the world 
consider a family going shopping over the weekend 
the other reason is many people see exotic cars as luxury items and that encourages the car industry 
now the market is occupied by lots of cars with varying comforts 
it is also undeniable that if a man has diversifed knowledge it would be immediate use 
in my opinion i think advertisements make products seem much better than they really are 
so some people use their car only for moving somewhere 
they have to think twice before performing even routine activities in life 
most of the actors soldiers workers and students are young people 
to respond adequately to the world we live in we need to understand it first 
in fact even today most of these systems run on electricity which can be harnessed in several non polluting ways 
compared to older people they do n t have enough time to enjoy their life 
also it has been on all the sections because when we use the head phones it makes a lot of noise and it is seriously very hard to stay on task 
they are clean big and so on 
and a rolling stone gathers no moss says proverb 
it is difficult to only watch lectures 
and there are a lot of critics concerned that the required testing is too long to be valuable for patients 
i have a reason to study english 
buses should be reserved for spots where there is no possibility to set up tramway routes 
i think that it is not always fair because not all the students work in the same way and with the same responsibility 
of course things are new and very risky 
for example little children are told not to cross the street at a red light because it is dangerous and we should n t let kids learn from a car crash 
in my opinion students need knowledge 
so because more people are able to buy cars the demand for and production of cars will increase and in the end this means that the number of cars will increase in twenty years time 
first they have spent too much time using computers so they do n t know how to properly communicate 
i would also like to say that understanding concepts and ideas is a much more important way of studying for students 
i ordered them and was promised that they would be delivered to my house in a few days 
we know that prescribed burning should be repeated every few years but it s very expensive to prescribe burnings every few years 
the second difference between the encyclopedia and information on the internet is that there are a lot of viruses and hackers on the internet and hackers can easily change information regarding any topic 
for example if i want to win a case in court in which technical questions are to be considered it is not enough to just know about the law 
second determine if there is any problem with the goods 
some people might say hey how does energy come 
successful people try to do new things like use any machine that could possibly help people 
however the problem is how long will it take us to find out that we are actually being controlled by the advertisements and the perfect image they gave us 
comsumers are not likely to buy a pair of trousers when the claim is that they will increase capacity to fly 
hence german students will have to work harder think much more and thus become even more skilled 
one reason is that endangered animals are breaking nature 
so i think that having self confidence is more important than having knowledge 
a younger person however will need time to define his or her wants in life 
the work should be good and not just a meaningless bundle 
natural disasters will always bring damage to the economy 
it s rightly said that life is not about adding years to life but life to years 
first advertisements make me want to puchase things i did n t plan to buy 
there are two major reasons it is beneficial to socialization and to mental health 
for these reasons i have to get a high score on the toefl exam 
i believe this number is increasing and will continue to increase as generations of educated people pass on their wisdom to their children 
in my opinion the need for community service and volunteerism arises in the absence of adequate resources or when somebody is not fulfilling their responsibilities 
when i consumed that drink i came to understand that we should not believe in advertisements 
but it is very different from that one in the passage 
they just impress upon people so well that people are compelled to buy it 
since i liked the interior so much i bought the car a few days later 
exactly like the phrase jack of all trades master of none 
the economy would benefit because this would enable it to compete with car manufacturers worldwide 
he and i are good pals but we do n t want to get lower scores than each other 
it is composed of not only seniors but also university students 
one of them is the long term wastefulness of the process 
and if you have knowledge in all areas then it gives you an added advantage to you knowledge level 
that is because if i became a member i would be highly esteemed by my friends 
so governments and scientists are also promoting less use of private cars because they are one of the greatest attributers to air pollution 
people use public water to drink 
that will never cause the economic problem 
this is not very easy to use 
but in my opinion if you want to be a successful person you should be brave try new things and take risks 
on the other hand scientists agree that the predators are beneficial to control the population of the menhaden 
do we consider her a smart girl 
for example in a chemistry class when you talk about oxygen being needed for a burning process you can provide a fact to support your idea which might be that you can put out a fire with a blanket because it cuts off the oxygen 
every beginning has its end 
who we match them together with 
they explain specific points by using examples of the dinosaurs behavior and physical appearance 
the lecture mentioned the mongol court records of the time 
it is harmful to people animals and it pollutes water sources 
firstly a teacher teaches students the right way to do things and affords confidence to students 
we do n t usually study these subjects very deeply 
you often find people investing money in inventions only to sustain their own business 
for instance many people use airplanes ships and trains 
as a former law teacher at the university of belgrano i have experienced the problems students faced when taking their oral law examinations 
first reason being that students are very open to criticism and always have many ideas to develop their opinions 
they may go to the house where the elderly person lives and help the elderly person to eat food and walk 
there are many big streets in my town 
the young passed the disease to a couple of people here and the young are still enjoying life 
it would be a really wasteful idea 
for example they can read again if they want back to the page that they cannot understand or they are impressed by 
tour guides are generally trained and certified by some supervising entities therefore they are expected to be ready to provide the best possible guides to their customers 
however i still believe that learning facts are important for the student 
while you will be able to help each other and work together after graduating from university 
he usually brings a book and asks someone when he wants to understand the book 
the operation room is not a bookmaker office or lottery house 
this means that the more languages you know the better you can communicate in and travel to other countries 
recently scientists have been working on a new generation lie detector that can perform brain scanning to find out if a person telling the truth 
by keeping his focus on one industry or one subject he ensures that he is up to date and fully aware of all the current happenings in the industry or subject 
they had success and the power 
it will always be a plus for them 
there is going to be a huge market for the product if the product is totally brand new which makes for a large chance to make lots of money 
before it was n t like that back then we were at all times at the will of the man and depending economically on him 
when you are a teenager you start experiencing some sexual changes which in contrast changes your way of thinking thinking more about the other gender than thinking about toys and enjoying going out with some friends than staying home and playing with your toys 
this will help them to get good marks 
avoiding this will create a much purer and more natural world for our future generations to live in 
in extreme cases some even gain weight because of this 
firstly some emergent events happening in other countries or areas may happen in the place you live someday in future 
i feel that with the environmentally friendly benefits and with the attachment that society already has on cars the benefits will make people keep riding cars 
i do not want to go to the eiffel tower in paris or the statue of liberty in new york when i travel because they are too well known so i have already heard about and seen them 
others would like to spend more time shopping than going around places 
i feel this will give jobs to people because all car companies would have to adjust with this change from gas to water fuel use 
as a student who learns many subjects at the same time i found it very beneficial 
so it is complex looking after many new employees every year can be difficult 
in this case the advertisement totally makes an impact on that baby 
maybe they enjoyed life when they were younger too 
lastly business owners thought factories would help reduce their overall business expenses by reducing their transportation costs 
when a talk about research i mean ask people that had the product like friends family or go to forums on the internet 
as it is important to see your work in the context of your whole career he now benefits from his broadly chosen majors in college 
successful people have to do things they find stable and do what they already know how to do well 
the students must have improved to get the correct view of the grade 
there are bigger populations everywhere 
firstly the population of the world is increasing exponentially 
this person guides you through paradise and takes you to wonderful places 
really successful people gained their fortunes by trying something new something that no one else has ever done before and taking risks where people were too afraid to 
and you stand nowhere on any subject 
in this way anybody can reach success in his or her life and career 
there will be a lot of members that will have gone to the surface of the moon and they will return safely to earth 
now let s take the example of a millionaire who has n t managed to let go of his childish ways 
without facts ideas or concepts will not be developed 
for example when i was a freshman at meiji university in japan my classmates and i traveled to china 
some people dislike traveling in groups having to follow strict time schedules and following rules 
in this case older people can drink and can go to a lot of places such as night clubs bars and so on 
a specialist in any field will have better job opportunities offered to him and of course he will not have as many opportunities but whatever the opportunities they will be far better that what non specialists are offered 
second many of the disadvantages cars have will cease or decrease in the coming years which will make them more popular than what they are presently 
the same will happen to taxation on cars and gasoline 
nowadays the drinking of soda is an addiction to most people 
thus a series of people got together and asked the guide to change the schedule and the guide could not help but accept their opinions 
hence these advertisements may convince people that the brand being advertised is actually the best quality product when in fact it is not 
this system of economics is the best 
he pointed out that the climate plays a role in the erosion of materials 
if they are a family who likes to go places they would prefer a car against other vehicles 
if we are doing a job we like we will love doing that job no matter how difficult it is 
if you want to actually get to know someone or something you can spend the whole day with that person or place and if you do not you would n t have reason to even speak to that person or even go there 
an unsuspecting user cannot tell the century has been tampered with 
this is prevented if a broad choice is given 
usually i do n t want to be by myself in an unfamiliar place 
i think cars will not be completely replaced by new automobile innovations but they will certainly be fewer in numbers 
now i am a really happy girl because i found my confidence 
these advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are 
but in contrast the professor states in the lecture that it is impossible that the video is not expensive 
and to do that we need to move 
does age actually have an impact on the way you live your life 
robots can work all day and no one would be tired 
eventually some of them wanted to buy the product 
successful therapists know that one treatment can help one person but for a different person it may not be appropriate 
in today s world we have just developed the first aspect 
i had lots of problems with studying science 
it s big importance is conscious with the bad consequences of it s decline if people continue to prefer laying down at home watching bad tv programs and other ways of easy culture maybe more attractive to them but bad for our future 
so we are more successful the day of the exam 
the professor needs them to do a project 
and when you order a big mac and see the size of it it s nothing compared to what you see in commercials so anytime i see one i feel like throwing it in their face 
but i cannot use my model as my only inspiration to design a building 
although life is never easy age does n t ensure you can be protected from bad things 
if not we do not need to start its procedure 
it is called ballast water 
if there are more people like me the fashion market would develop 
the student must be capable of understanding ideas and concepts and at the same time know the way how they must be developed 
we are also able to deal with the problems found with it 
second there is evidence that associates the sphinx with a known old kingdom king 
the companies want to show their product as best as they can once in the competitive market and in this race they generally mislead the consumer 
first of all the lecturer thinks that using the gas tax to reduce the number of gas consumers is not good for economics 
but if he did one machine like that he if he wanted can do another differently but he does n t think that because he does n t know his own abilities 
and i think that young people were more politically engaged in previous times 
but being that we are young our body generates the new cells 
it is a brilliant idea and you know that you are really good working with small boys and girls but you have to risk your work your salary and with this almost your life for an idea that may or may not work 
it s modern life now 
briefly sharing the cost of a vacation trip is beneficial for travel 
there are youths who acquire immense pleasure and self satisfaction from helping in the community 
in order to get an eco certification many wood companies around the world have introduced new ecologically friendly practices 
for exemple you were working like broadcaster but in the office and city where you are working 
she knows just what the teacher has told her but nothing more 
when i have been to europe using this i save lots of money 
the last one is the proposed limit on menhaden fishing which could mean the reduction of this problem not only here but also in several countries 
even if the status of cars are still at the presently viewed as viable something else will of course take the place of cars in our lives and history tells us that advancement will never stop 
on admission to the university the subject breaks down in many subjects 
they would use bicycles due to their relatively cheap cost and minimal need for maintenance 
it will be unfair because it would affect low income americans much more seriously than well to do americans and listening to the part where the woman explains her reality does not reflect the real economic damages raising gasoline tax would do to low income americans 
but this is not the situation for the old people 
this might contribute to a decreasing number of cars especially in developed countries like we find in europe for example 
people who are trying to get into a good university study by themselves everyday while i play around without reviewing and studying 
but that is a different situation because the graduate at this stage will have already guaranteed his her bachelor s degree 
when facing such challenges only those who are perseverant determined and always strive until the last minute despite of the risks can be successful 
i was so mad at the tour i since then like to travel by myself and without a tour 
you can benefit from this knowledge in many situations 
but they are not examples for the whole young person community 
and governments will not provide good public transportation systems for many years later 
people are not dependent on other people or time schedules for example of trains trams and buses 
1 7 5 0 people were surveyed about being required to take all classes and having selective classes 
for example no one is going to ask his personal doctor which he sees when he has a flu if he can also perform heart surgery or transplant organs 
as a young person you participate in some high risk sports like for example mountain climbing but high a risk sport would be too hard for an old person participate in 
we ca n t stay on the internet for a long time 
they bring us to far places in a quite fast speed without much human physical exertion 
and people are not ready to pay the taxes 
furthermore with this evidence you will agree 
we are going to pink s hot dog 
in old times families tended to live in the same place for ages 
however many companies joined them that also sell textiles 
and details are the key element here especially in the academic domain 
for example my parents went on a group tour to my country of korea last summer 
with this you can learn and gain knowledge 
people are not and should n t be robots 
i think that young people are not able to think as deeply on things as older people 
cars became important things in our life 
my friends are celebrating at the party 
i was upset and depressed 
for instance when i was a university student i researched and reported about community history in groups 
thus most of the inhabitants in rural areas are the old ones 
this is very positive for the company and probably he will get a better position 
while air travel has increased in recent years there has been no decrease in car travel or car sales 
the product is always presented in a perfect way 
on one hand you have the general practitioners who look at all the basic problems related to the body while on the other hand you have the specialists who only take care of specific areas whether it be an orthopedic surgeon related to bones a cardiologist related to the heart or an ent ear nose throat surgeon 
the definition of young or old is not apparent 
all knowledge is connected 
first hunters are the most dangerous things in this world for birds 
hence in twenty years the need for man to go out and get what he wants will be out of question 
thus in my view the points made in the lecture surely challenges the specific details or the points made in the reading passage more effectively 
that is to say not all the old things lead to the failure 
the reason these problems occur is also because of the exam 
what would be its environmental impact 
this point affects the environments of the world in the case of wasting the energy 
if he satisfied his situation and did not make efforts to overcome himself not only he could be rememberd as a great artist but we also never meet many great music 
he might feel afraid or terrible when the same thing happens to him 
some people might give you a good plan 
when older people think like that it creates a big problem for young people 
many scientists searched the area but could n t find particles 
the question which is more important making students understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts can be answered based on the level of learning which the student is taking 
some people have said that a placebo is really a drug about 3 0 percent of patients agree with this idea 
they can get a great amount of money from these companies 
the delicious golden fries seen on television might actually be pale potato stumps fried almost to perfection in very very very old oil 
therefore the government in america should propose to raise the gasoline tax 
it will eat insects or animals that do damage to it so that it can avoid having to repair itself 
parents now have less time to bring up their children so grandparents might help them more frequently 
after that they have to find a well paying job 
but about myself i m gonna have it too because my brother always talks about it and i agree with that broad knowledge 
and it does n t matter if the people who take the risks achieve all the goals they had in mind what is important is that they made things and have proved that they can do a lot of things in their lives by always focusing on good results for themselves and the whole world 
i once read a report that said during the vietnam war more americans died on roads in their cars than on battlefield 
i know bill gates president of windows media is the richest man in the world 
with facts the students can only guess about the reasons behind the facts 
the cost of undergrad is very cheap in some countries such as france 
for example it happened to me when i studied the concept of inflation 
it would lead to tremendous air and noise pollution 
i particularly practiced for hitting rather than receiving 
people also do not do anything 
so to achieve that goal different techniques are used 
so they will be able to gain more knowledge during their free time 
so lets not lose hope and let the scientists do their jobs but i think being in a traffic jam is a stressful situation it requires time and patience and there are so many more disadvantages of a large number of cars 
when i was a senior high school student i spent all of my time studying for tests 
for example there may be elderly travelers which may cause slow movement due to their inability to walk fast 
this is evidence the company that made some of the products had to pay a lot of money to the broadcasting bureaus 
many people surrounding you admire your knowledge and try to get familiar with you 
first of all it is one area that has been allowed to become more developed 
in the 2 1st century our young people can learn a lot of academic subjects 
many climbers died because of the coldness and lack of oxygen 
the new things bring brainstorming which some people can not do 
the government would like to reduce the population with this fishing limit 
like disking would stop an advancing fire 
i would spend as much time as i wanted if i liked visiting the place 
so if you want me to choose right now i will choose ordinary milk instead of a special kind 
these days our communication is a very good step 
they sometimes teach poor people who cannot afford to go to college and they also teach poor kids 
if you randomly find a hotel it might be too expensive or it could be unsafe 
but not moving and always keeping to old ways can not improve a persons life 
local communities have the main role of protecting children if such children are their own or not 
if they are urged to understand the concept that is being passed on and to interact with the information the learning process will take place in a completely different way 
they were looking for work place or food so they had no space in their minds for their communities 
his success belongs to his ability to try 
but if one who majors in art also learns something about natural science he will have the fortune of gaining the ability to think more logically 
movies and other television shows provide a lot of information about how real life is 
there are many ways for this another example is a bottle of juice if it tastes bad they make their shape wonderful and make it colorful 
it is because they do not think of new things to promote or make the people feel good 
other tourists with experience can give you some travel tips 
the government should also try to reduce the striped bass population 
a lot of memories with enough time to remember will increase the possibility of enjoyment 
a scene of violence can have an effect on them 
the communities in general have reckoned that they need support from the young people they must make a reasonable appeal
