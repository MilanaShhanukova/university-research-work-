for example a man whose hobby is playing football must want to play football day until night and night until day again ,1
at least i do in my consulting job ,1

when i travel to see something i do not know when it will be open or closed and even though i check beforehand it might suddenly close ,1
its cost is half than the other but its life cycle is the same ,1
what we do now we can do later ,1
according to me there are two kind of studies the highly technical ones and the others ,1
thus we begin to share information and ask our own questions about a weaker subject ,1
for example in the 2 0 0 6 world cup form germany many coaches on a team work ,1
many scientists obtained clear results of investigations after the facts were on the table but before they could even begin to theorize about them ,1
this will give rise to holistic understanding ,1
they want to make people understand that their product is the best and you can really trust it ,1
there can be many other theories about the reasons for and methods of migration ,1
thus the environmental issue will encourage more people to consider ways to commute other than driving a car ,1
on the other hand he she can continue doing what they do well and hope to be noticed ,1
video is convenient but if teachers are concerned about students using textbooks is a good ability for students ,1
they tend to restrict traffic on certain days and hours and increase parking fees etc ,1
for instance we can consider that evolution exists ,1
so depending on the study it would be better one way or the other since the thing is to choose the right one ,1
i am really sorry to continue this way but right now i am taking the test in a room with five other people and we are all taking the test with computers ,1
in my opinion it is dependent on a particular person ,1
many people are killed by cars ,1
global warming and greenhouse effects have started recently ,1
examples if people who were good did something wrong they could develop into thieves robbers or criminals and make problems for other people ,1
for example when we talk about speed they must understand why it is dangerous it is better than if they have an accident and learn after that ,1
therefore people will be able to live with the automobile society and nature for the future ,1
then what if the speaker explains the project wrong ,1
one car should be used by three people so it will lessen the number of cars during the busy hours ,1
and they can make a product and sell it cheaper than most countries ,1
marco polo used the persian langage not chinese or mongolian ,1
this is because of their knowledge on many subjects ,1
the industry of the fishing affects the animals because these companies used the fish in the making of different foods like oil ,1
therefore i brought a car immediately ,1
although weather related factors should be considered such as the land shape of the area ,1
one of the reasons that the fish are important is the fish can be an important food for livestock and poultry ,1
the policy is mentioned in the passage ,1
such unwritten law is very serious but our world is serious ,1
also the youth have less mental pressure ,1
think about and create a fire escape plan ,1
finally the third piece of evidence that birds use a type of internal compass is that birds have crystals of the mineral magnetite embedded in their break ,1
if the teacher teaches them that they will go on to study about that ,1
just searching the internet we can find out what we want no matter how books may stimulate our imagination or how high quality the book is ,1
in one case for example the copper scroll notes merely that the treasure is hidden in the vicinity of a certain river ,1
in this case the student learned a concept that can be used in other fields ,1
this is the cheapest way for people to take a trip ,1
the lecturer says it is more important to provide enough fish to the people ,1
furthermore a tour guide will also provide safety and security for travel since they already know the dos and don ts of the tour ,1
on the other hand each academic field needs experts in order to progress ,1
which caused her situation to worsen ,1
for example one man is a football club fan ,1
by using new things what are usually unknown to them they are taking a risk ,1
you can see that in many books news programs newspapers tv shows and websites ,1
when many people were very young they must have made time to learn they did not have much time to enjoy life as much as possible ,1
this argument is not only true now it has always been ,1
the last thing they have to study is disease which means they will be safe ,1
the consumers also knows how advertisements are ,1
learn ,1
there are very successful politicians that have never tried something new ,1
you can become smarter than other people ,1
in my opinion this statement is groundless youngsters today do contribute to their communities to a great extent ,1
and now because of this man i am writing my essay by computer ,1
therefore we have to reduce sulfur and nitrogen dioxide ,1
most of the things i hear are not true ,1
i think it is very hard to describe the point and to make everyone understand because when a few people start to do so they will think it is not fair at all that they are the few who are suffering and other people will not get it and will continue doing the same thing it just makes those people think stupidly ,1
maybe at the beginning but time after time other animals in the environment will choose them as their new food ,1
the older man would prefer to enjoy all the time he has remembering that we live only once ,1
the scraping will cause heat and that heat energy will go into the car ,1
you will face huge difficulties in life if you do n t know at least something from every subject ,1
the younger generation is more adaptable and can therefore adapt to changing technology ,1
that is why i m here to be ready for my education that is to be specialized in one specific subject that i would like to learn in every detail ,1
furthermore the professor denies the reading passage which states that treasure does not exist and is just fiction ,1
i chose law and began to study everything about italian law ,1
ideas on how you can solve this problem will actually give you a solution to the problem ,1
after all until now i tried to stay on a diet and manage my health condition carefully ,1
knowledge plays an important role in the life which can be acquired by understanding concepts rather than learning things ,1
most people do n t care about the environment or how cars affect the ozone layer greatly ,1
in addition it has a negative influence on agriculture ,1
they also have more responsibilities than a younger person ,1
the professor said that this can be changed to the different environments ,1
this casts doubt in the reading passage s assertion that fluoride prevents dental cavities ,1
i on the other hand have no major responsibilities other than studying ,1
the good student must know how to understand and work hard to get the idea ,1
and the critics used few arguments ,1
secondly the information in the videos is in a common format the students are familiar with it ,1
it was a reasonable price ,1
of course local businesses that depended on park visitors suffered as a result ,1
the heart disease patients show improvement when they are taking a placebo ,1
besides young people usually like new fashion things like ipods or mp 3 players i can see that the majority of young people ca n t live happily without music in their ears and movies at home ,1
they go on and do it better ,1
however people do n t know there and they do n t know how to do better or what they ca n t do ,1
producing vehicles that are more fuel efficient will damage roads and that will cost a lot to repair ,1
measures should be taken to check the fish population ,1
some say this product is recommended for the most important doctors or something like that ,1
this creates people to fall into peer pressure ,1
and there are a lot of scientists who specialize in one specific subject that discover important concepts or invent things which make our society more convenient ,1
for example last month i bought a product for skin because the advertising got my attention ,1
newer vehicles are something that could fly in the sky the we need not worry about traffic jams ,1
this offers you a lot more possibilities and you can stay at the places you like and avoid the ones you do n t ,1
but when we are in possession of these products are we really living the dream ,1
the sulfur dioxide is generated by several natural and human processes ,1
sulfur dioxide is released into the air with other pollutants ,1
one without the other is nothing ,1
menhadens are the primary source of protein for livestock and poultry ,1
i understand people who think that funny movies are more interesting than the others especially when you watch a movie with friends because it allows you to have fun with them ,1
in fact old buildings are costly to maintain ,1
while the child spends about five hours or less with his parents and whenever that child wants to go out he will probably go out with his friends which are classmates so most of his school life will be spent with his classmates and this will have a great impact on his personality which will determine the way the child will react towards his school and how he will live out his life ,1
they have a broader spectrum of ideas that they can develop into competences throughout their student life ,1
someone likes music and someone likes science and someone is talented in ballet while others are not ,1
i believe that the number of cars may decrease in twenty years time for various reasons ,1
this could help them to develop their thinking power managing power and good strategy making power to achieve their goals ,1
a perfect example of real politics was when bismark manipulated the letter written by the king and sent it to the french emperor napoleon iii ,1
in this case a tour guide can be helpful to complete the trip in less time as compared to what one might end up spending if one decides to explore the place alone ,1
what i wanted to say is that enjoying life cannot be put into a definition to test out if somebody is enjoying his or her life because it matches this definition ,1
but the owner that possesses one car dealer shop offered to him the other job with better conditions and benefits ,1
it s very obvious that more cars will be sold there ,1
also a food chain becomes stronger than it was before such as rabbits and bears ,1
for older people the phone s only function in some ways is a job or project where a master will call on him to help with related jobs ,1
according to me in order to start the carrier through its success it s important to have a solid base that means knowledge and experience ,1
therefore i support the statement that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts ,1
yes that s right but there are some young people that think about the idealism of their country about their communities in indonesia about their friend who ca n t eat or go to school ,1
the time to take a risk can be validated by consulting with others who are more professional than i am in sorting out the issues or solving risky problems ,1
however after the recommended burning the forests can grow plentiful and farmers can get more work than before ,1
maybe doing what they already know how to do is better than to be annoyed with something new ,1
but in general lies do not last very long ,1
technology has grown so fast because everyone tries to work on an invention due to some ideas he developed and concepts that have been applied to this idea from different subject areas ,1
hence from the very beginning children form a hesitancy to interact with other people which time only solidifies ,1
he actually changed the way he played in the latter part of his career when he won all those championships ,1
we will continue to invent and produce more sophisticated technology based on our own comfort which will decrease our ability to perform physical activities ,1
facts are learned by experinces ,1
in my opinion if they start one subject never give it up ,1
this contradicts the passage that it is a bad influence to economics ,1
the purpose of traveling is using a lot of your time to release your mind is n t it ,1
the bass is not only a predator for menhaden so if people catch more bass the population of other fish will also grow ,1
today they are using this method as a curative measure but with increasing importance of preventative medicine normal healthy individuals are leaning towards not using cars whenever possible ,1
this shows that people are aware of the disadvantages of getting old and getting less pleasure from life and try to delay or disguise it in any possible way ,1
in fact we will need a lot of space to park all these cars so we need a project for this ,1
government uses that money for public use and safety ,1
second sphinx is known for an old kingdom king ,1
or is this the right thing to do ,1
i started to have an interest in math and spent a lot of time solving math problems and i got a good score on exams it makes me have more passion about math ,1
even after school he has to participate in games and other extra curricular activities that are compulsory to attend ,1
he has a lot of money and a name but no family life ,1
even though the place i went was kyoto which is the most beautiful city in japan they have interesting temples nothing really remains in my mind after the trip because i was just part of a group following a tour guide without thinking ,1
broad knowledge on may subjects is not possible to acquire ,1
i also think that the ad is a method to make the people happy because you can dream ,1
it is more exciting and memorable ,1
the first clue is that there are rocks near the coast which are considered to be made by chinese explorers ,1
however his trying still brings him to success ,1
since i was in a group i should respect the group rules ,1
one good way to be safe and have a good time is to travel with a group and find a good tour guide ,1
i think that there is nothing i want in this tired city so why would father and mother want to visit it ,1
the lecturer went against the author s insistence for the following reasons ,1
in addition once he told me that he will never take the risk of doing other work because he has been working on this for 1 2 years and is already fluent at it ,1
for example the most famous inventor thomas edison was asked a question when he applied for a loan to a bank one more time for his experiments which were failing ,1
they behave as though they were just spontaneously praising a product during normal conversation ,1
to my surprise nothing happened ,1
for example they do not like to wait ,1
like the lecturer suggests we could subsidize the poor and this policy helps to put the right price on our natural resources and environment ,1
there are cars that use gas to power them ,1
they can bring that problem for improvement to many companies that will produce a new product ,1
education is the basis of opportunities and the amount of subjects in which a person has knowledge provides more opportunities in all aspects of life like work and helping others ,1
it usually makes them more positive to do it ,1
in both advertisements it is said that these tooth pastes will make your teeth brilliant and brighter ,1
we must trust ourselves ,1
that seems what people live for ,1
insufficient closet space inefficient heating and decaying plumbing makes life harder to live in old houses ,1
the advertisement says that the car has space for ten people when the truth is that the car just has space for four people another example is a skin soap advertisement that says the soap is the best because it will make your skin as soft as a 1 5 year old princess or as soft as the skin of jennifer lopez ,1
that means people that have something that is specialized in one subject could have a better chance of being hired ,1
and chimps can also remember what researchers said and almost perfect repeat what they said ,1
he will consider himself losing the years that he spent on collecting the money ,1
in addition the technology on which these mass transport systems function are based primarily on non conventional sources of energy ,1
first of all old houses are not necessarily suited to the needs of mordern residents ,1
of course it has the risk of failing but imagine the fantastic sensation of victory if his second bakery is as much as successful as the first one ,1
there are many people that do n t think before making a choice ,1
third although the passage claims they are dinosaurs because their bone structure is similar to endothermy scientist assume that it is not the case ,1
ten years ago a family that consists of five members owned at least two cars and that satisfied their transportation needs ,1
for example we can see on the discovery channel in the wild many people enjoy learning about the animals ,1
actual markets require more specific knowledge than broad knowledge ,1
only by breaking out of your normal life can you discover new perspectives in your job and your private life ,1
i said yes ,1
when you are successful you will have reasons to live ,1
the important thing is traveling without a tour guide ,1
fish firming uses the lots of special products such as fish meal ,1
lawyers are usually young people ,1
extending the same example as stated above i can tell you that during the worst period of amitabh bacchan he was offered a job in politics to take advantage of his publicity and would be paid heavily for it he was very much in need of financial support but mr bacchan rejected this offer because he knew how politicians play with the emotions of common people ,1
and when we want those energy sources we need to extract them from the ground and soil or oceans because those energy types are found in those places ,1
new plants could not grow after the fires ,1
people who are realistic can be more successful as we can see throughout history ,1
they are not stopping at the same time ,1
it means to understand war development you should understand the ideas and cultural movements that resulted in a particular period and helped for the occurring of that war for example ,1
in the commercials they are all good ,1
a different passage emphasizes an alternative to prescribed burning that uses the term disking a method that uses fire to clear out dry and dead shrubs thus stimulating the growth of new plant life ,1
this saved valuable time one can invest in more important activities ,1
but even if this student passes the course he she will not be a successful lawyer in the future about contracts ,1
in other words the variety of these towns might yield some changes that would encourage people who are interested in old things ,1
however there were n t any particles ,1
that shows that few animals could sustain and be active in this harsh and cold environment ,1
the way i see it the only thing that guides do is limit you and even more when you re in a group ,1
the facts were n t as important as the context ,1
these ideas and concepts usually contain academic researches that are totally reliable and dependent on the facts ,1
from this the professor agreed with some ideas and disagreed with some ideas ,1
but i went to jeju island more than three times ,1
i would have a variety of answers subjective to each person s field of interest ,1
the second one is to specialize in one specific subject one has his own test to study for so let us talk about this subject ,1
i think that the car twenty years from now will use electric fuel and not gasoline ,1
after this effort many companies in the world started actions to get this eco certified ,1
is it right ,1
any user who has used any toothpaste definitely knows that this can never be true ,1
after the construction of the first commercial car in 1 9 0 8 the ford t mankind has been subdued to the use of the car ,1
everybody loves him and he does as well ,1
successful people have gone through lots of hardship ,1
young people are still trying to obtain experience while older people have it already ,1
hence ideas and concepts are more reliable than the facts ,1
this has to do with the signs of our nature that we encounter nowadays ,1
for example drivers might memorize where the speed camera is located ,1
take toys for example advertisements that target children in particular are the best example of the way advertisements create a false image of the product ,1
the car was our answer to the needs of transportation sixty years ago and they will continue to be twenty more years from now ,1
they need cars for many things such as transportation entertainment and business ,1
because of the commitments men have to make to go to the army men have to sacrifice their precious time of youth ,1
if scientist will do something different like modifying the form of carbohydrate gelatinized and non gelatinized and then incorporating that into fish feed then fish may have a greater chance of growth and then be utilized more efficiently much to the appreciation of everyone ,1
while the results from both experiences are same the method and the time that brings a result is not the same ,1
because you do not need to be a hero in order to try new things you just need to want it and know that any result will be a success in things that you want or in learning ,1
they have to consider the negative side of their suggestion ,1
in such a situation there is no other way ,1
in the reach family all members have a car ,1
i held the map and tried to find all the famous points that it had marked on it ,1
even the magnitudes on mars are no evidence of life on mars ,1
for example when i traveled to france and italy alone i met a person in nice who was a famous producer of the song in taiwan ,1
finding oil and petrol and digging for it is a very expensive procedure ,1
i hope the things i learned will help me in the future ,1
for these reasons the passage said that it is time for the state to take measures to reduce the quantity of sulfur dioxide ,1
i think there must be many subjects better than just one subject ,1
also the animal population got better and recovered really well after the fire ,1
it provides a lot of wood to the industries ,1
some loose points in the wall ,1
the gas byproducts from cars will destroy the earth s environment and increase its temperature ,1
in writing we are nearly unable to express people s feelings but via action on tv we can understand these feelings better than from books ,1
these kind of fish ca n t live so long in water that contain salt ,1
everybody knows that today the truth of competitive markets in each and every field we re facing plenty of competition and if you are choosing a career in the field of software for example you have to master the subject and then you can easily get a job ,1
because you share only a single interest it makes you a loner ,1
in addition students want to learn the language and they want to use it so when they understand the concepts and the ideas it will help them to learn the language ,1
indeed they can be refused ,1
unfortunately we are individuals living isolated in society ,1
but if they need money for these purposes they can work extra hard ,1
learn ,1
however after i learned all aspects of a company such as marketing accounting leadership financial accounting and business communication etc ,1
an example that confirms or supports my point clearly is the chinese car ,1
furthermore it is way better to have knowledge than to guess and learn common facts that anyone could learn through the media ,1
it is the main resource that cars need to run ,1
from my personal experience when i was too busy to find the information the internet was a very useful and fast tool ,1
but then as it has been rightly said by someone we are the victims of our own greedy needs ,1
this is very useful for them ,1
but by then we have already bought the product and end up losing the money ,1
and we say that these countries are going to be the next developed countries ,1
my 1 0th exam and 1 2th exam are very good ,1
if they learn one thing they will learn another until they know how it works and what the useful aspects of it ,1
i am sure that most of the kids knew that this was not the way their parents taught them because they do not know why it was wrong or why they should do things the ways their parents told them to ,1
we can see young people working with other countries and other people with tools like the telephone or internet even if it looks like they are spending time just for themselves by spending the whole day in their room ,1
also most people prefer to entertain athletics rather than the arts ,1
therefore he likes to do risky and strange things and he enjoys it ,1
but after a few days i found myself enjoying it ,1
however if they just work in the field which they already know how to do well they might feel sad and tired ,1
i believe to specialize in one specific subject outweighs having broad knowledge of many academic subjects ,1
in my opinion if someone thinks one is more important than the other why not focus on one ,1
and people feel more awkward when it comes to their ears that this is something that is a current event ,1
he would never want his business or company to be stagnant ,1
however i would prefer traveling by myself with good preparation and be filled with joy ,1
carbon dioxide is very harmful to people ,1
and i had to listen to success attracts success and money attracts money ,1
also they can go shopping and buy new fashionable clothes ,1
it s a really good film ,1
after that i studied the topic in more depth and understood the ideas and concepts of the topic ,1
when the forest is caught on fire the wood turns into ashes which is potassium ,1
in my opinion cars will become self driving in twenty years ,1
the fact of the matter is that a lot of academic subjects can not be used separately ,1
according to the lecture management should plan carefully by hiring well trained people or teach current employees how to be prepared for a fire ,1
and it is important to have emotions in classes like history or social studies ,1
in old age people leave all their burdens behind and spend their time on work they re interested in ,1
every time when we meet i will look forward to the new things ,1
although some people say that the treasures are already found ,1
as far as i am concerned i agree with this statement but some people may not agree with my opinion ,1
car usage in the united states is very important in every day life as well as in many latin american countries and third world countries ,1
however companies tend to cut their profits for workers ,1
many people are willing to buy these cars ,1
this one is the copper scroll ,1
another solution could be the developing of more fuel efficient cars which could also be good for american car manufacturers who will produce more attractive cars to sell to other countries ,1
consequently i agree with the statement for three reasons effect on one s view talking face to face with people and meeting for the first time ,1
first of all the population of the world is going down ,1
my wife and i always go to tokyo around december ,1
therefore the problem of running out of fuel is out of the question augumenting my view that the number of cars will continue to rise ,1
first effect is global warming ,1
so ho chi minh city will develop ,1
peolple like to drive different types of models and they want something extra in it ,1
these useful skills that i learned from reality are going to be the greatest gifts for my future career and they can not be found in textbooks anyway ,1
that s why i will not be as hard as when i am alone ,1
high cost produces high quality medicine ,1
this is an important thing ,1
books sometimes contain outdated information so they may be wrong ,1
to combat those problems people started to use cheaper transportation instead of cars ,1
however i agree that having knowledge is useful whenever we need necessary information ,1
but when the teacher asked me did i understand it i said yes ,1
so i disagree with the statement and i think it is much better to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects ,1
raising the gas tax could be the most effective way to decrease gas consumption for three reasons ,1
next kids are more attracted to the advertisements ,1
successful people can explain any other matter and discuss any other problem ,1
but it is dangerous because some drivers make trouble with other drivers and then the drivers crash their cars when the streets are busy ,1
because it is already fixed data nobody can create a problem with this type of literature ,1
also the professor indicates that we should be careful when we use the prescribed fire solution ,1
if they cannot pay the high prices anymore people have to start using a bus or a train ,1
this will reduce the pollution caused by cars releasing carbon dioxide ,1
moreover they have to learn about advanced course material ,1
sometimes age in my view is a barrier to some things in life ,1
in simple words they say they lost their appeal ,1
for example nursing students study in a nursing college for three to four years ,1
i believe that the product s quality mentioned in the shops is exactly the same as given in the ads ,1
then define your goals and work hard to achieve them ,1
critics of this policy focus on three points first yellowstone fires scorched a large area of land and a lot of plant species were lost ,1
in my past experiences there are some lectures which are completely based on facts and there is a slim chance for me to apply them ,1
when you understand the idea is one way you can figure out the statement that you see in the moment ,1
however a lot of reasons explain what the placebo effect does ,1
in today s world there is a high and almost undying thirst for change ,1
the kids can stay outside every day and play ,1
firstly i think that communities equal human relationships ,1
it may spoil the health also ,1
water is necessary to live ,1
i ve seen many times on tv the same people rich people who are interested in politics sports new technologies and also in space ,1
as a result studies in britain have shown that fluoride increases the activity that can lead to more bone density and therefore less bone fractures among the elderly ,1
also sometimes people may meet some new friends in the group they are traveling with ,1
if students just learn facts they would just forget them but this would not happen so easily if they understand properly the concepts behind the facts ,1
when i started completing my homework on time i gradually improved ,1
because if i study in this way i will gain so much and i also will have a lot of information from the books ,1
when you understand the concepts and ideas it is up to you to prove them to see if they are really what you have been told and i think this is the main reason why students prefer facts rather than just understanding ideas and concepts ,1
for example if you are attempting to study arts and sciences and are trying to get qualifications in both you are an extraordinary creation ,1
therefore as long as it is a country where i can understand their language i will travel alone ,1
the government will try to do something to not pollute the air ,1
so in this field it is very important to understand all the concepts and ideas they gave us and use them to solve problems ,1
because they sent out 2 0 of all carbon emissions ,1
in my opinion is so easy to understand one thing for example processes than to remember many divided facts or dates ,1
it is also necessary to take risks rather than just doing what you are supposed to ,1
no scientist would have ever come up with their wonderful inventions and the world would have never progressed ,1
there will be a technological development in the future but it will only promote the use of public transportation systems not personal cars ,1
not being with a guide gives you the liberty to visit the places you want to visit at your own pace and with the liberty to go anywhere you want to go ,1
usually in advertisements a presentable face is used to present a product such as a model a cute baby or a known face such as a sportsmen only to get the product to look better than it actually is ,1
not that bungee jumping is something that every young person wants to do but even if he wanted to do it he probably would n t be able to ,1
close up video clips of a juicy hamburger flying around the screen clearly satisfying the model eating it could easily create in viewers a false sense of being hungry and urge them to hop in a car and drive to a nearby fast food restaurant to buy what they saw ,1
so only time will tell what actually happens ,1
as we have all known when we were out something we ca n t expect would happen such as disease an accident or something else ,1
and then makers of cars need to develop the systems for safety almost completely ,1
third the professor agrees that the gas prices in the united states are cheap and they should raise them to save the environment and people s health ,1
nowadays there are many people who think they are the most important thing and they only have to work for themselves ,1
in general there are many people in the book ,1
but they do things in a different manner than others do which gives them success ,1
people feel more secure and comfortable to travel with their own car rather than travel using several public transportation vehicles to reach their destination far later than they would desire ,1
the second critique of this method is that the costumer loses all critical though and that he is not on guard ,1
as a result it will be easier for you to learn many things ,1
in short these were critical parts that contradicted the reading materials ,1
i think it s harder for a successful person to risk something becuase they could lose much more than others ,1
we can have a glance of what s happening in the world by accessing the internet using mobile devices also ,1
so the importance of communities in society decreased ,1
but found that successful people use money from other people and use their ideas for a way to success ,1
in my case when i did a job interview the employer asked me commonsense questions about society policy art and so on ,1
at some time they have to face their failures and struggles ,1
because it transmits eastern european habits to different places in the world ,1
consider a family going shopping over the weekend ,1
the other reason is many people see exotic cars as luxury items and that encourages the car industry ,1
now the market is occupied by lots of cars with varying comforts ,1
it is also undeniable that if a man has diversifed knowledge it would be immediate use ,1
in my opinion i think advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ,1
so some people use their car only for moving somewhere ,1
they have to think twice before performing even routine activities in life ,1
most of the actors soldiers workers and students are young people ,1
to respond adequately to the world we live in we need to understand it first ,1
in fact even today most of these systems run on electricity which can be harnessed in several non polluting ways ,1
compared to older people they do n t have enough time to enjoy their life ,1
also it has been on all the sections because when we use the head phones it makes a lot of noise and it is seriously very hard to stay on task ,1
they are clean big and so on ,1
and a rolling stone gathers no moss says proverb ,1
it is difficult to only watch lectures ,1
and there are a lot of critics concerned that the required testing is too long to be valuable for patients ,1
i have a reason to study english ,1
buses should be reserved for spots where there is no possibility to set up tramway routes ,1
i think that it is not always fair because not all the students work in the same way and with the same responsibility ,1
of course things are new and very risky ,1
for example little children are told not to cross the street at a red light because it is dangerous and we should n t let kids learn from a car crash ,1
in my opinion students need knowledge ,1
so because more people are able to buy cars the demand for and production of cars will increase and in the end this means that the number of cars will increase in twenty years time ,1
first they have spent too much time using computers so they do n t know how to properly communicate ,1
i would also like to say that understanding concepts and ideas is a much more important way of studying for students ,1
i ordered them and was promised that they would be delivered to my house in a few days ,1
we know that prescribed burning should be repeated every few years but it s very expensive to prescribe burnings every few years ,1
the second difference between the encyclopedia and information on the internet is that there are a lot of viruses and hackers on the internet and hackers can easily change information regarding any topic ,1
for example if i want to win a case in court in which technical questions are to be considered it is not enough to just know about the law ,1
second determine if there is any problem with the goods ,1
some people might say hey how does energy come ,1
successful people try to do new things like use any machine that could possibly help people ,1
however the problem is how long will it take us to find out that we are actually being controlled by the advertisements and the perfect image they gave us ,1
comsumers are not likely to buy a pair of trousers when the claim is that they will increase capacity to fly ,1
hence german students will have to work harder think much more and thus become even more skilled ,1
one reason is that endangered animals are breaking nature ,1
so i think that having self confidence is more important than having knowledge ,1
a younger person however will need time to define his or her wants in life ,1
the work should be good and not just a meaningless bundle ,1
natural disasters will always bring damage to the economy ,1
it s rightly said that life is not about adding years to life but life to years ,1
first advertisements make me want to puchase things i did n t plan to buy ,1
there are two major reasons it is beneficial to socialization and to mental health ,1
for these reasons i have to get a high score on the toefl exam ,1
i believe this number is increasing and will continue to increase as generations of educated people pass on their wisdom to their children ,1
in my opinion the need for community service and volunteerism arises in the absence of adequate resources or when somebody is not fulfilling their responsibilities ,1
when i consumed that drink i came to understand that we should not believe in advertisements ,1
but it is very different from that one in the passage ,1
they just impress upon people so well that people are compelled to buy it ,1
since i liked the interior so much i bought the car a few days later ,1
exactly like the phrase jack of all trades master of none ,1
the economy would benefit because this would enable it to compete with car manufacturers worldwide ,1
he and i are good pals but we do n t want to get lower scores than each other ,1
it is composed of not only seniors but also university students ,1
one of them is the long term wastefulness of the process ,1
and if you have knowledge in all areas then it gives you an added advantage to you knowledge level ,1
that is because if i became a member i would be highly esteemed by my friends ,1
so governments and scientists are also promoting less use of private cars because they are one of the greatest attributers to air pollution ,1
people use public water to drink ,1
that will never cause the economic problem ,1
this is not very easy to use ,1
but in my opinion if you want to be a successful person you should be brave try new things and take risks ,1
on the other hand scientists agree that the predators are beneficial to control the population of the menhaden ,1
do we consider her a smart girl ,1
for example in a chemistry class when you talk about oxygen being needed for a burning process you can provide a fact to support your idea which might be that you can put out a fire with a blanket because it cuts off the oxygen ,1
every beginning has its end ,1
who we match them together with ,1
they explain specific points by using examples of the dinosaurs behavior and physical appearance ,1
the lecture mentioned the mongol court records of the time ,1
it is harmful to people animals and it pollutes water sources ,1
firstly a teacher teaches students the right way to do things and affords confidence to students ,1
we do n t usually study these subjects very deeply ,1
you often find people investing money in inventions only to sustain their own business ,1
for instance many people use airplanes ships and trains ,1
as a former law teacher at the university of belgrano i have experienced the problems students faced when taking their oral law examinations ,1
first reason being that students are very open to criticism and always have many ideas to develop their opinions ,1
they may go to the house where the elderly person lives and help the elderly person to eat food and walk ,1
there are many big streets in my town ,1
the young passed the disease to a couple of people here and the young are still enjoying life ,1
it would be a really wasteful idea ,1
for example they can read again if they want back to the page that they cannot understand or they are impressed by ,1
tour guides are generally trained and certified by some supervising entities therefore they are expected to be ready to provide the best possible guides to their customers ,1
however i still believe that learning facts are important for the student ,1
while you will be able to help each other and work together after graduating from university ,1
he usually brings a book and asks someone when he wants to understand the book ,1
the operation room is not a bookmaker office or lottery house ,1
this means that the more languages you know the better you can communicate in and travel to other countries ,1
recently scientists have been working on a new generation lie detector that can perform brain scanning to find out if a person telling the truth ,1
by keeping his focus on one industry or one subject he ensures that he is up to date and fully aware of all the current happenings in the industry or subject ,1
they had success and the power ,1
it will always be a plus for them ,1
there is going to be a huge market for the product if the product is totally brand new which makes for a large chance to make lots of money ,1
before it was n t like that back then we were at all times at the will of the man and depending economically on him ,1
when you are a teenager you start experiencing some sexual changes which in contrast changes your way of thinking thinking more about the other gender than thinking about toys and enjoying going out with some friends than staying home and playing with your toys ,1
this will help them to get good marks ,1
avoiding this will create a much purer and more natural world for our future generations to live in ,1
in extreme cases some even gain weight because of this ,1
firstly some emergent events happening in other countries or areas may happen in the place you live someday in future ,1
i feel that with the environmentally friendly benefits and with the attachment that society already has on cars the benefits will make people keep riding cars ,1
i do not want to go to the eiffel tower in paris or the statue of liberty in new york when i travel because they are too well known so i have already heard about and seen them ,1
others would like to spend more time shopping than going around places ,1
i feel this will give jobs to people because all car companies would have to adjust with this change from gas to water fuel use ,1
as a student who learns many subjects at the same time i found it very beneficial ,1
so it is complex looking after many new employees every year can be difficult ,1
in this case the advertisement totally makes an impact on that baby ,1
maybe they enjoyed life when they were younger too ,1
lastly business owners thought factories would help reduce their overall business expenses by reducing their transportation costs ,1
when a talk about research i mean ask people that had the product like friends family or go to forums on the internet ,1
as it is important to see your work in the context of your whole career he now benefits from his broadly chosen majors in college ,1
successful people have to do things they find stable and do what they already know how to do well ,1
the students must have improved to get the correct view of the grade ,1
there are bigger populations everywhere ,1
firstly the population of the world is increasing exponentially ,1
this person guides you through paradise and takes you to wonderful places ,1
really successful people gained their fortunes by trying something new something that no one else has ever done before and taking risks where people were too afraid to ,1
and you stand nowhere on any subject ,1
in this way anybody can reach success in his or her life and career ,1
there will be a lot of members that will have gone to the surface of the moon and they will return safely to earth ,1
now let s take the example of a millionaire who has n t managed to let go of his childish ways ,1
without facts ideas or concepts will not be developed ,1
for example when i was a freshman at meiji university in japan my classmates and i traveled to china ,1
some people dislike traveling in groups having to follow strict time schedules and following rules ,1
in this case older people can drink and can go to a lot of places such as night clubs bars and so on ,1
a specialist in any field will have better job opportunities offered to him and of course he will not have as many opportunities but whatever the opportunities they will be far better that what non specialists are offered ,1
second many of the disadvantages cars have will cease or decrease in the coming years which will make them more popular than what they are presently ,1
the same will happen to taxation on cars and gasoline ,1
nowadays the drinking of soda is an addiction to most people ,1
thus a series of people got together and asked the guide to change the schedule and the guide could not help but accept their opinions ,1
hence these advertisements may convince people that the brand being advertised is actually the best quality product when in fact it is not ,1
this system of economics is the best ,1
he pointed out that the climate plays a role in the erosion of materials ,1
if they are a family who likes to go places they would prefer a car against other vehicles ,1
if we are doing a job we like we will love doing that job no matter how difficult it is ,1
if you want to actually get to know someone or something you can spend the whole day with that person or place and if you do not you would n t have reason to even speak to that person or even go there ,1
an unsuspecting user cannot tell the century has been tampered with ,1
this is prevented if a broad choice is given ,1
usually i do n t want to be by myself in an unfamiliar place ,1
i think cars will not be completely replaced by new automobile innovations but they will certainly be fewer in numbers ,1
now i am a really happy girl because i found my confidence ,1
these advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are ,1
but in contrast the professor states in the lecture that it is impossible that the video is not expensive ,1
and to do that we need to move ,1
does age actually have an impact on the way you live your life ,1
robots can work all day and no one would be tired ,1
eventually some of them wanted to buy the product ,1
successful therapists know that one treatment can help one person but for a different person it may not be appropriate ,1
in today s world we have just developed the first aspect ,1
i had lots of problems with studying science ,1
it s big importance is conscious with the bad consequences of it s decline if people continue to prefer laying down at home watching bad tv programs and other ways of easy culture maybe more attractive to them but bad for our future ,1
so we are more successful the day of the exam ,1
the professor needs them to do a project ,1
and when you order a big mac and see the size of it it s nothing compared to what you see in commercials so anytime i see one i feel like throwing it in their face ,1
but i cannot use my model as my only inspiration to design a building ,1
although life is never easy age does n t ensure you can be protected from bad things ,1
if not we do not need to start its procedure ,1
it is called ballast water ,1
if there are more people like me the fashion market would develop ,1
the student must be capable of understanding ideas and concepts and at the same time know the way how they must be developed ,1
we are also able to deal with the problems found with it ,1
second there is evidence that associates the sphinx with a known old kingdom king ,1
the companies want to show their product as best as they can once in the competitive market and in this race they generally mislead the consumer ,1
first of all the lecturer thinks that using the gas tax to reduce the number of gas consumers is not good for economics ,1
but if he did one machine like that he if he wanted can do another differently but he does n t think that because he does n t know his own abilities ,1
and i think that young people were more politically engaged in previous times ,1
but being that we are young our body generates the new cells ,1
it is a brilliant idea and you know that you are really good working with small boys and girls but you have to risk your work your salary and with this almost your life for an idea that may or may not work ,1
it s modern life now ,1
briefly sharing the cost of a vacation trip is beneficial for travel ,1
there are youths who acquire immense pleasure and self satisfaction from helping in the community ,1
in order to get an eco certification many wood companies around the world have introduced new ecologically friendly practices ,1
for exemple you were working like broadcaster but in the office and city where you are working ,1
she knows just what the teacher has told her but nothing more ,1
when i have been to europe using this i save lots of money ,1
the last one is the proposed limit on menhaden fishing which could mean the reduction of this problem not only here but also in several countries ,1
even if the status of cars are still at the presently viewed as viable something else will of course take the place of cars in our lives and history tells us that advancement will never stop ,1
on admission to the university the subject breaks down in many subjects ,1
they would use bicycles due to their relatively cheap cost and minimal need for maintenance ,1
it will be unfair because it would affect low income americans much more seriously than well to do americans and listening to the part where the woman explains her reality does not reflect the real economic damages raising gasoline tax would do to low income americans ,1
but this is not the situation for the old people ,1
this might contribute to a decreasing number of cars especially in developed countries like we find in europe for example ,1
people who are trying to get into a good university study by themselves everyday while i play around without reviewing and studying ,1
but that is a different situation because the graduate at this stage will have already guaranteed his her bachelor s degree ,1
when facing such challenges only those who are perseverant determined and always strive until the last minute despite of the risks can be successful ,1
i was so mad at the tour i since then like to travel by myself and without a tour ,1
you can benefit from this knowledge in many situations ,1
but they are not examples for the whole young person community ,1
and governments will not provide good public transportation systems for many years later ,1
people are not dependent on other people or time schedules for example of trains trams and buses ,1
1 7 5 0 people were surveyed about being required to take all classes and having selective classes ,1
for example no one is going to ask his personal doctor which he sees when he has a flu if he can also perform heart surgery or transplant organs ,1
as a young person you participate in some high risk sports like for example mountain climbing but high a risk sport would be too hard for an old person participate in ,1
we ca n t stay on the internet for a long time ,1
they bring us to far places in a quite fast speed without much human physical exertion ,1
and people are not ready to pay the taxes ,1
furthermore with this evidence you will agree ,1
we are going to pink s hot dog ,1
in old times families tended to live in the same place for ages ,1
however many companies joined them that also sell textiles ,1
and details are the key element here especially in the academic domain ,1
for example my parents went on a group tour to my country of korea last summer ,1
with this you can learn and gain knowledge ,1
people are not and should n t be robots ,1
i think that young people are not able to think as deeply on things as older people ,1
cars became important things in our life ,1
my friends are celebrating at the party ,1
i was upset and depressed ,1
for instance when i was a university student i researched and reported about community history in groups ,1
thus most of the inhabitants in rural areas are the old ones ,1
this is very positive for the company and probably he will get a better position ,1
while air travel has increased in recent years there has been no decrease in car travel or car sales ,1
the product is always presented in a perfect way ,1
on one hand you have the general practitioners who look at all the basic problems related to the body while on the other hand you have the specialists who only take care of specific areas whether it be an orthopedic surgeon related to bones a cardiologist related to the heart or an ent ear nose throat surgeon ,1
the definition of young or old is not apparent ,1
all knowledge is connected ,1
first hunters are the most dangerous things in this world for birds ,1
hence in twenty years the need for man to go out and get what he wants will be out of question ,1
thus in my view the points made in the lecture surely challenges the specific details or the points made in the reading passage more effectively ,1
that is to say not all the old things lead to the failure ,1
the reason these problems occur is also because of the exam ,1
what would be its environmental impact ,1
this point affects the environments of the world in the case of wasting the energy ,1
if he satisfied his situation and did not make efforts to overcome himself not only he could be rememberd as a great artist but we also never meet many great music ,1
he might feel afraid or terrible when the same thing happens to him ,1
some people might give you a good plan ,1
when older people think like that it creates a big problem for young people ,1
many scientists searched the area but could n t find particles ,1
the question which is more important making students understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts can be answered based on the level of learning which the student is taking ,1
some people have said that a placebo is really a drug about 3 0 percent of patients agree with this idea ,1
they can get a great amount of money from these companies ,1
the delicious golden fries seen on television might actually be pale potato stumps fried almost to perfection in very very very old oil ,1
therefore the government in america should propose to raise the gasoline tax ,1
it will eat insects or animals that do damage to it so that it can avoid having to repair itself ,1
parents now have less time to bring up their children so grandparents might help them more frequently ,1
after that they have to find a well paying job ,1
but about myself i m gonna have it too because my brother always talks about it and i agree with that broad knowledge ,1
and it does n t matter if the people who take the risks achieve all the goals they had in mind what is important is that they made things and have proved that they can do a lot of things in their lives by always focusing on good results for themselves and the whole world ,1
i once read a report that said during the vietnam war more americans died on roads in their cars than on battlefield ,1
i know bill gates president of windows media is the richest man in the world ,1
with facts the students can only guess about the reasons behind the facts ,1
the cost of undergrad is very cheap in some countries such as france ,1
for example it happened to me when i studied the concept of inflation ,1
it would lead to tremendous air and noise pollution ,1
i particularly practiced for hitting rather than receiving ,1
people also do not do anything ,1
so to achieve that goal different techniques are used ,1
so they will be able to gain more knowledge during their free time ,1
so lets not lose hope and let the scientists do their jobs but i think being in a traffic jam is a stressful situation it requires time and patience and there are so many more disadvantages of a large number of cars ,1
when i was a senior high school student i spent all of my time studying for tests ,1
for example there may be elderly travelers which may cause slow movement due to their inability to walk fast ,1
this is evidence the company that made some of the products had to pay a lot of money to the broadcasting bureaus ,1
many people surrounding you admire your knowledge and try to get familiar with you ,1
first of all it is one area that has been allowed to become more developed ,1
in the 2 1st century our young people can learn a lot of academic subjects ,1
many climbers died because of the coldness and lack of oxygen ,1
the new things bring brainstorming which some people can not do ,1
the government would like to reduce the population with this fishing limit ,1
like disking would stop an advancing fire ,1
i would spend as much time as i wanted if i liked visiting the place ,1
so if you want me to choose right now i will choose ordinary milk instead of a special kind ,1
these days our communication is a very good step ,1
they sometimes teach poor people who cannot afford to go to college and they also teach poor kids ,1
if you randomly find a hotel it might be too expensive or it could be unsafe ,1
but not moving and always keeping to old ways can not improve a persons life ,1
local communities have the main role of protecting children if such children are their own or not ,1
if they are urged to understand the concept that is being passed on and to interact with the information the learning process will take place in a completely different way ,1
they were looking for work place or food so they had no space in their minds for their communities ,1
his success belongs to his ability to try ,1
but if one who majors in art also learns something about natural science he will have the fortune of gaining the ability to think more logically ,1
movies and other television shows provide a lot of information about how real life is ,1
there are many ways for this another example is a bottle of juice if it tastes bad they make their shape wonderful and make it colorful ,1
it is because they do not think of new things to promote or make the people feel good ,1
other tourists with experience can give you some travel tips ,1
the government should also try to reduce the striped bass population ,1
a lot of memories with enough time to remember will increase the possibility of enjoyment ,1
a scene of violence can have an effect on them ,1
the communities in general have reckoned that they need support from the young people they must make a reasonable appeal ,1
,1
so i think we can not live if old people could not find silences and technologies and they did not developed ,0
for not use car ,0
here was no promise of morning except that we looked up through the trees we saw how low the forest had swung ,0
thus even today sex is considered as the least important topic in many parts of india ,0
image you sale you are quark in factory just to do one thing like pot tare on car if they fire you you will destroy because u font know more than pot tare in car ,0
they draw the consumers like me to purchase this great product with all these amazing ingredients and all that but actually they just sometimes make something up just to increase their sales ,0
i want to talk about novice or bad products like alcohol hair spray and cigarettes ,0
for example they can play football whenever they want but the older can not ,0
it figures diana kr all wearing a rolex watch and has a text that suggests that if the reader wants to belong to the restricted club not necessarily of rolex watch wearers but of highly talented sophisticated and competent artists he or she should also have a rolex ,0
there are several reason ,0
also the work of the media television magazines and every stuff made for publicity affects the emotions of many people around the world encouraging them to buy and buy anything they can ,0
since most urban areas are occupied with cars they are all facing up with an irresistible problem of air and noise pollution ,0
it is true that consumers prefer to buy a product that has a lower price but when international companies that has already the certification begins to send its market people will prefer to consume theirs because the difference between prices is probably not going to affect them to much ,0
4 they have a big chance to prepare for their future life,0
one person if do n t have good health that means so many things they could lost ,0
many studies over the last 5 0 years have shown that people who have fluoride in their drinking water are considerably have less cavities than people who have not drinking non fluoridated water ,0
likewise the theory generating from the concept of memory is also not the appropriate way due to limited memory ,0
because they spent time meaningful subjects ,0
i was very fast my best time was 5 5 seconds in 4 0 0 hundred meters is a good time in or country ,0
and young people spend time more thee lifestyle ,0
if in this society who will not to do study they never concept there opportunity or ca n t understand any ideas so most of the important that in this situation and i also very interest ion and also prefer that for the study material ,0
we have to know this problem it s serious but almost people doens t know about this ,0
students can focus on only a few subjects they are interested in and they will become an experts in those areas ,0
but in other watchmakers other way country need to pay extra money to make repair the roads what they did is reduce the amount of gas consumers high the gas tax and low the income tax because they thought only rise the gas tax is unfair ,0
today mba students with a background in engineering are in high demand ,0
in the case of young people the best way is studying as hard as possible to get better grades so in the future they will have better chance to find better jobs ,0
so the school try learning the students a bit in every science exist ,0
i think they have to get skill on it ,0
specializing in one particular subject does not suit our life in this era which is characterized by diversity and innovation,0
i will explain my points of views in the following paragraphs ,0
he thinks differently from other people and he succeed ,0
these activities make the community a better place to live in and inculcate these values in all the members ,0
because all those broad knowledge help they to understand their major in university as well as help they to make a correct choice in specializing study ,0
and it was very easy to me to understand why he always bran bad marks at home ,0
then when we went to the science olympiad she could have diverse knowledge about the subjects and it was not new for her to think about new things ,0
if every people thinks to learn and understand lots of scientific subjects any person will do not do it and as a result of this any science is n t imported ,0
thus in concordance with the above i agree whole heatedly that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ,0
third the butt it in hte front of the door of store to make the people see it even if it is not good,0
however are these things all good to people ,0
very soon they will run out at the current rate of utilization ,0
in the lecture however professor oppose the reading statement ,0
but you have to create these opportunities ,0
thoughts our lives needs talk about our family ,0
they try new things ,0
in order to do this they would need to learn additionally skills either theoretical or practical that would increase their understanding and future application of their chosen subject ,0
if you want a product you give create a beautiful image around it if you want sell it ,0
secondly the place of the film must must be very clear and sir must be relax etc ,0
and will put you mains on a non stop learning ,0
this will the proof of speeding offense so that polices can easily catch them ,0
in today s computer skill is first important life skill ,0
he last chooses to learn truth ,0
i never have stopped myself to think this but this is a real possibility for the future ,0
young has his own field and word on it hard and do more benefits to the society ,0
and about the new information there is editors ,0
if we consider an idea as a totally autonomous concept within the individual process of defining reality i will state that ideas are useless not being based on experience ,0
he she wants to know everything about the universe wants to know everything about the god the death etc these some concepts that everyone can encourage a lot of ideas but the facts are not found yet ,0
it so expensive that only those people can do this besides of their allay living ,0
they make very high profits year after year and the numbers also increase year after year ,0
for this reason the number of cars would be decrease in the future ,0
so he took upon himself to narrow his research on this subject which was a mystery to the world ,0
others who do n t have this concept they will sell unverified wood ,0
i did n t have self confidence ,0
if there are specialized doters the doter has done the operation very often before so he is really talented in his job ,0
so it will be good situation ,0
also i have traveled in a group without tour guide ,0
the school teachers there the one who take the future of you generation so we have to give them to get the better knowledge ,0
so this test is very important with theirs ,0
but most time it is important because most student is not ably and his think and ideas is very important ,0
otherwise it will be a problem for us to understand certain thing in life ,0
i myself like to participate in kind of activities and meet many people who would like to do ,0
second the amount of treasure locations are implausibly large ,0
he mainly concentrate on the questions asked him at the time of interview ,0
because when we learn about some subjects we should have more information about what we study so that the student will get the information more easier and more better and this is my first reason ,0
in a market economy the price must reflect costs of the product and consumer s willingness to buy the product ,0
some tour guide who will want to set maximum security make tour difficult because you will only have a wonderful view through the bus ,0
because the fashionable culture has been changed ,0
actually that was so unstable trip ,0
it is obvious that after returning i was tired and the night is meant to sleep ,0
nowadays we need a person who are capable of all sorts of works ,0
finally fish farming relates to long term wastefulness which can pollute the sea ,0
establishing connections with other researchers will open the door for new projects with other researchers ,0
now i have outstanding scores ,0
he knows that there is no return in his help to others ,0
furthermore my friends who are nineteen years old drive their own car and they would like to buy always another one ,0
as the cities were smaller it was less violence noise traffic ,0
there can not be no bothering and no dazzle ,0
even though he knows the advertisement is unreal or looks to pretty he is going to buy the product ,0
these are several opposing points i observed between lecture and passage ,0
even though she does not have job she also need car to use pick up her kids or go shopping ,0
in early industry a lot of warier worked together ,0
it kept anasazi from living in american southwest by very high temperature it caused droughts ,0
i have several reason to support my choice ,0
because one time you get success and next time will why not ,0
while at university he might specialize in a subject while still taking a number of diverse other courses ,0
now we have all information around us ,0
both of these men have leaded with situations in an unconventional manner and the results are with everyone to see ,0
this shall effect in exams ,0
moreover take risks teaches you to accept both winning and losing that is the most important lesson one should learn in order to achieve any kind of objective ,0
i would like to initiate myself whatever i do on my trip to get much out of my trip ,0
however one student pointed out my mistakes ,0
it s normal propose something to the client and construct something different is the best way and it s legal ,0
this is how we are transforming our society at the present days the actual fact of being against this statement is that we are looking what we want at the moment in order to have a great time ,0
not only this without a clear understanding of what is being taught the student would not be able to perform well in the tests ,0
for example a man whose hobbies is playing football he must want to play the ball day until night and night until day again ,0
at least i do in my consulting job ,0
although the few lucky ones struck gold most of the people simply vanished as they left their homes only to be forgotten and some of them even developed obsessions for the western mirage ,0
and like the citizens of the developed countries these people want to possess cars themselves ,0
we grip on many subject we get ample exposure greatly and easily ,0
but on the other hand thee is also people that is often convinced by the interesting advertisements they see everywhere because of this many times they have to face problems with the product that they bought and many times thee is no way to give back that product ,0
they take responsible the future of their society and the results it can the most helpful thing for society ,0
so the conclusion is clear ,0
and you can change your views and ideas but you can not change ypu fact ,0
an old person has to give way to a younger one no matter whether he likes it or not ,0
ever increasing competency rates force them into frequent business model changes for a compatible transitional flexibility ,0
however this reading passage casts dots on the speaker s mention ,0
however all of them are limited ,0
that is what it gives us a lot of opportunity to think ,0
the placebo effect is not illusion but the real so the drug was effected the placebo effect ,0
when i go to travel to see something i want we do not know about when it is open or close even though i study before it might be suddenly close ,0
its cost is half than other but life cycle is the same ,0
what we do now we will able to do later ,0
according to me there are two kind of studies the ones highly technical and the others ,0
thus we begin to share a information and ask own s weaker subject ,0
for example in 2 0 0 6 world cup form germany as many conch wan na term work ,0
many scientists obtained clear results of investigations after the facts were on the table before they could even began to theories about them ,0
this will give rise to a holistic understanding ,0
they want to make people understand they she product is the best and really you can trust on it ,0
there can be any other theories about migrating reason and about the methods of migrating ,0
thus the environmental issue will push more people to consider another way to commute instead of driving a car ,0
on the other hand he she can continue doing what they do well and hope to be noticed ,0
video is convenient but if teachers concern about students so using textbooks gives good ability for students ,0
they tend to restrict traffic in certain days hours increasing parking fees etc ,0
for instance we can consider that evolution exists ,0
so depending on the study it would be better oin way or the other one the thing is to choose the right one ,0
i am really sorry to continue like this but right now i am taking the test in a room with 5 more person other than me and we all are taking the test with the computer ,0
in my opinion it is depended on particular person ,0
many people killed by car ,0
global warming and green house effects had started recently ,0
examples if the good skill people do some thing wrong ways and they got good respond like thief robber stolen criminal and make problems to another people ,0
for example when we talk about speed they must understand why it is dentures is better than if they have antecedent after that they learn ,0
therefore people will be able to live with the automobile society and the nature for the future ,0
then how about if the talkative explains the project erroneously ,0
one car should be used by three persons so it is hoped will lessen the number of car during the busy hour ,0
and they can make a products and sell it cheaper than most countries ,0
marco polo used persian language not chinese or mongolian ,0
this is because of their knowledge on many subjects ,0
the industry of the fish affect this animals because this companies used the fish in the elaboration of different foods like oil ,0
therefore i brought a car immediately ,0
although the weathered factors could be considered such as the land shape of the area ,0
the one of the reason that the fish is important is the fish can be a important bay for livestock and poultry ,0
once the policy mention in the reading passage ,0
such unwritten law is very furious but our world is the furious ,0
also the youth have less mental pressure ,0
think about creates a fire break ,0
finally the third cause that birds use a type of internal compass birds have crystals of the mineral magnetite embedded in their break ,0
if the teacher teach them that they will go to study about that ,0
just searching the internet and we will find out what we want no matter how books will stimulated our imagination and how high quality the book it is ,0
in one case for example the copper scroll notes merely that treasure is hidden in the divinity of a certain river ,0
in this case student learn a concept and it is possible to use in other fields ,0
this way is the cheapest way for people to have a trip ,0
the lecture says it is more important to provide enough fishes to people ,0
furthermore a tour guide will also provide safety and security for the travel since they know already the do s and don ts in the tour ,0
on the other hand each academic field needs specialists in order to progress ,0
which caused her situation to be worse ,0
for example one man is a football club fans ,0
by using new things which is usually is un known for them and it includes risk with it ,0
you can see that in many books news newspaper tv computer ,0
when many people were very young they must have man time to learn knowledgeable they don not have much time to enjoy life as much as possible ,0
this argument is not only true now it is since ages i want to talk on a live example of sir ,0
last one is they have to study about disease which means that will be save ,0
the consumers also know how advertisements are ,0
 learn ,0
there are very successful politicians that never tried something new ,0
you can become smarter than the other people ,0
in my opinion this statement is groundless and the youngsters today do contribute to their communities to a great extent ,0
and now because of this man i am writing my essay by computer ,0
therefore we have to reduced sulfur and nitrogen dioxide ,0
most of the the things i hear are not true ,0
i think it is very hard to distribute the point and to make every one to understand because when few people started to do so they would think it is not fair at all they are the few who are suffering other people can not get it and continue doing the same thing it just make those people thinks stupid ,0
maybe at the beginning but time after timer other animals in the environment will choose them as their new food ,0
the older man would prefer to enjoy all the time he has remembering that we live only once ,0
the scraping will causes heat and that heat energy will go into the car ,0
you will face huge difficulties in life if you font know at least something from every subject ,0
younger generation are more adaptable thus they can adapt to changing technology ,0
that is why i m here to be ready for my education that is to be specialized in one specific subject that i would like to learn in every details ,0
furthermore the professor denies the reading passage which states that treasure does not exist and it is just fiction ,0
i chose law and began to study everything about italian law ,0
but ideas of how you can solve this problem will actually give you a solution to the problem ,0
after all personally until now i try to go on a diet and manage my health condition more carefully ,0
as well as the knowledge plays also important role in the life which can be squired by the understanding the concepts rather than learning the things ,0
most people do n t care about the environment or how consuming cars affect the ozone layer greatly ,0
in addition it have a enigmatic influence on agriculture ,0
also they have more responsibilities than young person ,0
the professor said this can be changed to the different environments ,0
this casts doubt in the reading passage s assertion that fluoride prevents dental cavities ,0
i on the other hand have no major responsibility other than studying ,0
the good student must know how to understand and work hard to get the aide ,0
and the critics use few arguments ,0
secondly the information in videos is very delivered in format it very familiar with students ,0
it was a reasonable price ,0
of course local businesses that depended on park visitors suffered as a result ,0
the heart decease patients shows improvement when they are taking placebo ,0
besides young people usually like new fasion thing like ipod or mp 3 i can see that main part of young prole ca n t live happily without music in their ear and movies at home ,0
they are go on do it and do it for better ,0
however people do n t know there and they do n t know how to do is better or what they ca n t to do ,0
producing vehicles that are more fuel efficient will damage roads and that will cost a lot to repair ,0
so measures should be taken to check the fish s population ,0
some said this product is recommended for the most important doctor or something like that ,0
this creates people to pier pressure ,0
and there are a lot of scientist who just specialize in one specific subject discover important concepts or invent things which make our society more convenience ,0
for example last month i bought a product for skin actually i bought the product because the advertising got my attention ,0
newer vehicles are something could fly the sky then we need t annoy about tragic jams ,0
this offers you a lot more possibilities and you can stay at places you like and avoid the ones you do n t like ,0
but when we are in possession of these products are we really living a dream ,0
the sulfur dioxide is generate by several natural processes and several human processes ,0
sulfur dioxide is released into the air with other pollutants ,0
one without the other is nothing ,0
menhaden are the primary source of protein for the livestock and poultry ,0
i understand people who think that funny movies are more interesting than the others especially when you watch a movie with friends because it allows to have fun with them ,0
in fact old buildings are costly to maintain ,0
while the child spends about five hours or less with his parents and whenever that child wants to go out he will most probably go out with his friends which are his classmates so most of his school life will be spent with his classmates and this will have a great affect on his personality which will determine the way the child will react towards his school and will determine how he will use his life ,0
they have a broader spectrum of ideas that they can develop into competences throughout their student life ,0
someone likes music and someone like science and some one is talent on ballet while someone is not ,0
i believe that the number of cars may decrease in twenty years time for some reasons ,0
this could help them to develop their thinking power managing power and good strategy making power to achieve their goals ,0
a perfect example of real politic was when bismarck manipulated the letter written by the king and sent it to the french emperor napoleon iii ,0
in this case a tour guide can be helpful to complete the trip in very less time as compared to what one might end up spending if one decides to explore the place himself herself ,0
what i wanted to say is that enjoying life can not be putted into a definition to test out if somebody is enjoying his or her life because it matches this definition ,0
but the owner that posses one car dealer shop effort to him other job with better conditions and benefits ,0
it s is very obvious that more cars will be sold there ,0
also food chain becomes more stronger that is was before such as rabbits and hear ,0
for the older the phone the only function in some means is a job a project a imper winch master call on him with the related to the jobs ,0
according to me in order to start the carrier through the success it s important to have a solid base that means knowledge and experience ,0
therefore i support the statement that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts ,0
yes that s right but there are some young people people think about the idealism of his country about their communities in indonesia about their friend who ca n t eat who ca n t go to school ,0
the time to take a risk can be compensated with consulting others who are more professional than me in sorting out the issues or solving the risky problems ,0
however after prescribed burning the forests can grow up plentiful and farmers can get works more than before ,0
maybe be doing what they already know how to do well is better than to b enjoyed with something sounds news,0
but in general lies do not last very long ,0
technology has grown so fast because everyone tries to work on an invention due to some ideas he has developed and concepts that have been applied to this idea from different subject areas ,0
hence from the very beginning children form this hesitancy from interaction with other people which time only solidifies ,0
he actually changed the way he played in the latter part of his career when he won all those championships ,0
we will continue to invent and produce more sophisticated technology based on our own comfort which will decrease our ability to perform physical activities ,0
facts are learned by experiences ,0
in my opinion if they start one subject never give up ,0
this contradicts the reading passage s that it has bad influences to economics ,0
the purpose of travel is owning a lot of your time to release mind is n t it ,0
the bass is not only predator for menhaden so if people catch more basses the population of another fishes also will grow up ,0
they are today using this way as a curative measure but with increasing importance of preventive medicine normal healthy individuals are also attracted towards not using cars wherever possible ,0
this shows that people are aware of the disadvantages of getting old raspsquo among them getting less pleasure from life and try to delay or disguise it in any possible way ,0
in fact we will need a lot of place were parking all this cars so we need a lot of project for this incrismt of cars ,0
government use that money in public use and safety ,0
second sphinx is known for old kingdom king ,0
or is this the right thing to do ,0
i stated to have been interest in math i spent lot of time to solve math problems and i got good score at exam it make have more passion about math ,0
even after school he has to participate in games and other extra curricular activities that are compulsory to attend ,0
he has a lot of money and name but no family life ,0
even though the place i went was kyoto which is most beautiful city in japan and they have most valuable and interesting temples nothing really remain in my mind after the trip because i was just part of the group and following a tour guide without thinking ,0
board knowledge on may subjects is not possible to acquire ,0
i also think that the ad is a method to feel happy the people because you can dream ,0
it is more exciting and memorable ,0
the first clue is that there are rocks near the coast which are considered to be made by chinese explorers ,0
however his trying still bring him to success,0
since i was in a group i should respect the group rule ,0
one good way to be always safe and have a good time is to travel with a group and chose a good tour guide ,0
i think that there are not anything i want what a tired city why my father and mother want to visit this city ,0
the lecturer against the author s enlistments following reasons ,0
in addition once he told me that he will never take risks of doing other works because he s been working for it for 1 2 years and he is already raspsquo fluent raspsquo at it ,0
for example the most famous thomas edison was asked a question when he applied for a loan to a bank one more time for his experiments which were failing ,0
they behave as though they were just spontaneously praising a product during boring normal conversation ,0
to my surprise nothing happened ,0
for example they do not like to wait much ,0
but like the lecturer suggest we could subsidize the poor and this policy help to put the right prices to our natural resource and environment ,0
there are cars that use gas to power them ,0
they can bring that problem to improve for many company that will produce a new product ,0
education is the basis of opportunities and the amount of subjects in which a person has knowledge conditions his or her opportunities in very important aspects of life like work and even helping others ,0
it usually makes them to be more postie to do it ,0
in both advertisements is said that these tooth pastes will make your teeth brilliant and brighter ,0
we must trust ourselves,0
that seems why people live for ,0
insufficient closet space inefficient heating and decaying plumbing makes life harder to live in old houses ,0
the advertisement says that the car has space for 1 0 people when the truth is that the car is just 4 people space another example is an advertisement of a skin soap they said that this soap is the best because they say your skin wile be as soft as a fifteen years old princess or that your skin will be as soft as the jennie lopez s skin ,0
that means people have something that is specializing in one subject could get more chance of hiring ,0
and chimps can also remember what researchers said and almost perfect reply what researchers said ,0
he will concede him self losing the years that he spent on collecting the money ,0
in addition the technology on which these mass transport systems function are based primarily on non conventional sources of energy ,0
first of all old houses are not necessarily suited to the needs of modern residents ,0
of course he has the risk of failing but imagine the fantastic sensation of victory if his second bakery is as much as successful as the first one ,0
there are many people that do n t think before take a choose ,0
third although the reading passage claims dinosaurs because their bone structure is similar to endothermic scientist assume that it is not the case ,0
ten years ago a family that consists of five members owns at least two cars and it satisfies the transportation ,0
for example we can see on the discovery channel in wild life many people are hobbies to learn from the animals ,0
actual market requires more specific knowledge that broad knowledge ,0
only by braking out of your normal life you can discover new perspectives in your job and your private area ,0
i sad yes ,0
when you be successful you will have a reasons for live ,0
and the important is travel without the tour guide ,0
fish firming uses the lots of special products such as fish meal ,0
lawyers are young people ,0
extending the same example as stated above i can tell you during the most worst period of imitable bacchanal he was offered to enter into politics to take advantage of his publicity that he had got and he will be paid for it heavily so he was very much in need of financial support mr bacchanal had rejected this offer only because he knew that how politicians play with the motions of common people ,0
and when we want got those energy we need despot the ground and soil or oceans because those energy were found in those place ,0
new plant could not grow after the fires ,0
realist people can be more successful as we can see in history ,0
they are not stop at the same ,0
it means to understand an war development you should understand the ideas and cultural movements that resulted in a particular period and helped for the occurring of that war for example ,0
in the commercials they are all good ,0
alternative reading passage emphasize about alternative to proscribing burning by giving some turn like diking in this fire clear out dry and dead shrub and stimulate the growth of new plant life ,0
this saved valuable time one can invest in more important activity ,0
but even if this student passes the course he she will not be a successful lawyer in the future about contracts ,0
in other words the verity of these towns would give some changes that might use to enc urge people who are interested in old things ,0
however there were n t any particles ,0
that shows that few animals could sustain and active in this harsh and cold environment ,0
the way i see it is that the only thing that guides do is limit you and even more when your in a group ,0
the facts were n t as important as the context ,0
these ideas and concepts usually contain academic research which are totally reliable and dependent on the facts ,0
from this professor agreed some ideas and dis agreed some ideas ,0
but i went to jujube island more than three times ,0
i would have a variety of answers subjective to every person field of interest ,0
the second one is to specialize in one specific subject one has his own tacit in studding so let us talk about this subject,0
i think that the car twenty years from now will use electric fuel not gasoline ,0
after this effort many companies in the world starter actions to get this certify ,0
is it right ,0
any user who has used any toothpaste infidelity knows that this can never be true ,0
after the construction in 1 9 0 8 of the first commercial car the ford t man kind has been subdued to the use of the car ,0
everybody loves him and he does the same ,0
successful people had gone through lots of hardship ,0
younger people are still trying to obtain experience although lode have it already ,0
hence ideas and concepts are more reliable than the facts ,0
this has to do with the signs of our nature that we encounter nowadays ,0
for example drivers might memorize where the speed camera is located ,0
take toys for example advertisements that target children in particular are the best example of the way advertisements create a false image of the product ,0
the cars were our answer to the needs to transportation sixty years ago and they will continue to be twenty more years from now ,0
they need the cars fore many things sheaths as transportation inter tanmant and bigness ,0
because of the requirement of men going to army men have to sacrifice their precious time of youth ,0
if scientist will do something different like if he she can modify the form of carbohydrate like gelatinized and nongelatinized carbohydrate then incorporated in fish feed then fish may be utilize more than previous then if fish utilize more then chances of growth will be more then it may be appreciated by everyone ,0
while turned out results from both experiences are same the method and the time that brings a result is not same ,0
because you do not need to be a hero in order to try new things you just need to want it and know that any result will be a success in things that you want or in learning ,0
they have to consider the negative side of their suggestion ,0
in a such situation there is no other way ,0
in the reach family all the components have a cars ,0
i held the map and tried to find all the famous points that had marked on it ,0
even the magnitudes on mars are no evidence of life on mars ,0
for example when i traveled france and italy alone i met a person in nice who was a famous producer of the song in taiwan ,0
finding oil and petrol and digging for it is a very expensive procedure ,0
i hope those things i learned will help me in the future ,0
for this reasons the passage said that it is time for state to take measures to reduce the quantity of sulfur dioxide ,0
i think there must be many subject better than one subject ,0
also the animal population got better and they recovered really good after the fire ,0
it provides much wood to the industries ,0
some luce points in wall ,0
the gas from cars will destroy the environment of the earth and it will heat earth up ,0
in writing we are nearly unable to show the flings of people but in the action on tv we can understand well than book ,0
these kind of fish ca n t live so long in water that contain salt ,0
every body no that the truth today is a competition maker in each and every field we are facing competition for example if you are choosing you career in software field than you have to master on that subject than you can easily get a job ,0
because you share only a single interest thus making you a loner ,0
in addition students want to learn the language and they want to use it so when they understand the concepts and the ideas it will help them to learn the language ,0
in deed they can be reduced ,0
unfortunately we are individuals and living isolated on the society ,0
but if they needs money for these purpose they can do a extra handwork ,0
learn,0
however after i learned all sides happening in a company such as marketing accounting leadership financial accounting and business communication etc ,0
an example that confirms or supports my point is clear in the chinese cars ,0
furthermore it is way better to live on knowledge than on guess and common facts that anyone could learn through the medias ,0
it is the main resource for the cars to be working ,0
from my personal experience when i was very busy to find the information the internet very useful and fast tool ,0
but then as it has been rightly said by someone we are the victims of our own greedy needs ,0
this is very useful for them ,0
but by then we have already bought the product and end up loosing the money ,0
and we says that these countries hon na be the next developed countries ,0
my 1 0th exam and 1 2th exam is very good ,0
if they do thing they go for another until they know how it woke and what is useful think of it ,0
i am sure that most of the kid knew that this was not the way their parents teased them because they do not know why was it wrong or why should they do the ways their parents told ,0
we can see young people working over countries or working for others with tools like telephones or internet even if they look they spend their time just for themselves by being whole day in their room ,0
also most of people prefer to entertain athletics rather than other arts ,0
there fore he likes to do risky and strange things and he enjoy it ,0
but after a few days i found myself enjoying in it ,0
however what if they just work for the field which they already know how to do well they might feel sad and tired ,0
i belie to have broad knowledge to specialize in one specific subject have outweigh than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects ,0
in my opinion if someone thinks one is more important than other why not to focus on one ,0
and people feel more awkward when it comes to their ears that this is something going on as a current event ,0
he would never want his business or company to be stagnant ,0
however i wooed prefer traveling by myself with the good preparation filled with joy ,0
the carebendiocside is very harm full for the people ,0
and i had listen success attract success and money attract money ,0
also they can go for shopping and buying a new fashionable clothes ,0
it s really a good film ,0
after that i studied in more depth to the topics and understood the ideas and concept of the topic ,0
when the forest is caught on fire the wood turns into ashes which is potassium ,0
in my opinion cars will be took full use of in the twenty years ,0
in the fact the matter that a lot of academic subject can not be used separate ,0
according to the lecture management should plan carefully when hire well trained people or teach them how to manage the fire in a better way before fire ,0
and it is important to have emotions in classes like history or social studies ,0
in the old age the people have leave all the burdens and they are spending their own interested work ,0
every time when we meet i will look forward to the new things ,0
although some people say that the treasures are already found ,0
as far as i am concerned i agree with this statement however some people are not agree with my opinion ,0
car usage in the united states is very important in every day life swell as in many latinamerican countries and third world countries ,0
however companies tend to cut their profits for workers ,0
many people are willing to buy these cars ,0
the one is the copper scroll ,0
another solution could be the developing of more fuel efficient cars winch could also be good for america s car manufacturers who will produce more attractive cars to sell to other countries ,0
consequently i agree the statement with regard to three reasons effecting of view face to face with people and the first time ,0
first of all the population of the world is going down ,0
my wife and i always go to tokyo around december ,0
thereby the problem of running out of fuels is out of the question thereby augmenting my view that the number of cars will continue to rise and not decline ,0
first affection is global warming ,0
so ho chi ming city will develop,0
people like to drive different types of models and they want some thing extra in it ,0
these useful skills that i learned from reality are going to be the greatest gift for my future career and they can not be found in the text books anyways ,0
that s why i will not hard as i am alone ,0
high cost produces high quality medicine ,0
this is important thing ,0
books some times have an old information so it will be wrong ,0
against those problems people started to use cheaper transportation instead of car ,0
however i agree that having knowledge is being useful whenever we necessary information ,0
but when teacher ask me did i understand it i said yes ,0
so i disagree with the statement and i think it is much better to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects ,0
raising tax for the gas can be the most effective and possible way to decrease the use of gas in three reasons ,0
next kids are more attractive to the advertisements ,0
successful people are explain any hoer mater and discuss any other problem ,0
but it dangerous because some driver make trumbull with other driver and they when some driver crash their car then streets are busy ,0
because it is already a fixed data so nobody can crest problem with this type of literature ,0
also the professor indicates prescribed fire should be careful when we use prescribed fire solution ,0
if they can not pay the high prices any more people have to change into a bus or a train ,0
this will reduce the pollution caused y the carbines from the cars ,0
moreover they have to learn about advance course material ,0
the age in my view sometimes is a barrier to do somethings in life ,0
in simple words they say they lost their appeal ,0
for example nursing students study in a nursing college for three four years ,0
i believe that the product s quality mentioned in the shops are exactly the same as given in the adds ,0
then define your goals and work hard to achieve them ,0
critics of this policy focus in three pins first yellowstone fires scorched a large area of land therefore a lot of plant species were lost ,0
in my past experiences there are some lecture which is completely abed on facts and the chance for me to apply them is just rare ,0
when you understand de idea is one way that you can figurout about the statement that you see in these moment ,0
however a lot of reasons explain about that the placebo effect does ,0
in today world there is a high and almost nonpunishable thirst for change ,0
the kids can stay outside every day and play ,0
firstly i think that communities equal human relationship ,0
it may spoil the health also ,0
water is needed for alive ,0
i the same other people see many teems on tv rich people are interested in politics sports new technologies and also in sparse ,0
as a result studies in britain have shown that fluoride increases the activity can lead to more bone density and therefore less bone fractures among the elderly ,0
also sometimes people may meet some new friends in the traveling group ,0
if students just learn facts they will forget them soon but this will not happen so easily if they understand properly the concepts that are behind the facts ,0
as on when i started completing my home work on time i gradually improved ,0
because if study in this way of curs i will gate so much i also will have a lot of information the book i study ,0
when you understand the concepts and ideas is up to you to prove them to see if they are really what you have been told i think this is the main reason why students prefer facts rather than just understanding ideas and concepts ,0
for example if you are attempting to study arts and sciences and to get qualifications in both you are extraordinary creation ,0
therefore as long as it is a country where i can understand their language i will travel alone ,0
government will try to do something to not pollute the air ,0
so in this field it is very important to understand all concepts and ideas which they gave us and use to solve problems ,0
because they sent out 2 0 of the whole carbon emission ,0
try to combine the process of my opinion is so easy to understand one thing process as i mean than to remember many divided facts or dates ,0
it is also take risks rasher than only doing ,0
no scientist would have ever come up with their wonderful inventions and the world would have never progressed ,0
there will be a technological development in the future but that will only promote the use of public transportation system but not car ,0
not being with a guide gives you the liberty to visit the places you want to visit at your own pace and with the liberty to deliberate to any place you want to go ,0
usually in the advertisements a presentable face is used they try to present some modals nice babies known faces as sports men only to let the product looks better than it was ,0
not that bungee jumping is something that every young person wants to do but even if he wanted to do it he probably would n t be able to ,0
close up video clips of a juicy hamburger flying around the screen surely satisfying the models eating it could easily create in the viewers a false sense of being hungry and urge them to hop into their car and drive to a fast food restaurant nearby to get what they have seen ,0
so only time will tell what actually happens ,0
as we all known when we were out something we ca n t expect would happen such as disease accident or something else ,0
and then makers of cars need to develop the systems for safe almost completely ,0
third the proffer agrees that the the gas prices in the united states are cheep and they should raid them to safe the environment and people s health ,0
now a days there are many people who think they are the most important thing and they only have to work for themselves ,0
in general there are many peoples in a book ,0
but they do things in a different mane than others which gives them success ,0
people feel more secure and comfortable to travel with their own car rather that changing several public transportation vehicles and reach their destination far later that they would desire ,0
the second critic of this method is that the costumer lose all critical reflex and that he is not in guard ,0
as a result it will be easier for you to learn many things ,0
in short these were critical parts that contradicted the reading materials ,0
i think it s harder for successful person to risk something that could lost much more then others ,0
we can have glance on what is happening in the world through accessing internet in mobile also ,0
so the importance of communities in society decreased ,0
but found that successful people use the people money and use there idea for a way to success ,0
in my case when i did a job interview the employer ask me question about commencements like society policy art and so on ,0
at some time they have to face the failure s and lot of struggles ,0
because it transmit the habitats from eastern europe to different places in the world ,0
considering a family going shopping in weekend ,0
the another reason is many people see some of exotic cars as luxury encourages the industries ,0
now the market is occupied by lots of cars with varying comforts ,0
it is also undeniable that if a man has diversified knowledge it would be immediate use ,0
in my opinion i think advertisements are make products seem much better than they really are ,0
so some people use car only by move somewhere ,0
they have to think twice before performing even routine activities of life ,0
most of the actors soldiers workers and students are young people ,0
to respond adequately to the world we live in we need to understand it first ,0
in fact even today most of these systems runs on electricity which can be harnessed by several non polluting ways ,0
comparing with older people they do n t even have enough time to enjoy their life ,0
also its been on all the sections because we use the head phones it makes a lot of noise and it seriously very hard to stay on task ,0
they are clean and big and so on ,0
and rolling stone gather no mass says proverb ,0
it is difficult only to watch educations ,0
and there is a lot of critics concerned that the rewired testing is so long that declined the valuable for patients ,0
i have a reason that study english ,0
buses should be reserved for spots where there is no possibility to set up tramway routes ,0
i think that it is not always fair because not all the students work in the same way and with the same responsibility ,0
of course things are new and very risky ,0
for example little children are told that do not cross the street at red light because it is so dangerous that we can not let kids learn from crash ,0
in my opinion students need to a knowledge ,0
so because more people are able to buy cars the demand for cars will increase and so the production of cars will also increase and in the end this means that the number of cars will increase from now to twenty years time ,0
first they have spend many time on the computer so they does n t know how to communicate ,0
i would also like to say that understanding concepts and ideas is a much more important way of studying for students ,0
i ordered them and was promised that they would be delivered to my house in a few days ,0
we know that prescribed burning shed be repeated every few years but its very expensive to spent every few year ,0
second difference between the encyclopedia is that there a lot of viruses and hackers in internet and one of the hackers can easily change the information about any kind of topic ,0
if i want to win a case in court in for example a case where technical questions are to be considered it is not enough to just know about the law ,0
second if there is any problem with the goods ,0
some people might say hey how does energy come ,0
the successful people try to do new things like any machine can help the people ,0
however the problem is how long will it take us to find out that we are actually controlled by the advertisements and the perfect image they gave us ,0
consumers are not likely to buy a pair of trousers when the claim is that they will increase capacity to fly ,0
hence german students will have to work harder think much more and thus become even more skilled ,0
one reason is that endangered animals is breaking nature ,0
so i think having overconfidence is more important than having knowledge ,0
a younger person however will need to time to define his or her wants in life ,0
the work should be good and not just bundle of meaningless ,0
always natural disaster bring economy damage ,0
its rightly said life is not about adding years to life but life to years ,0
first advertisement make me to buy some thing unplanned ,0
there are two major reasons it is profit to socialization and mental health ,0
for the these reasons i have to take high score on toefl ,0
i believe this number is increasing and will continue to increase as generations of educated people pass on their wisdom to their children ,0
in my opinion the need for community service and volunteerism arises in the absence of adequate resources or when somebody is not fulfilling their responsibilities ,0
when i consumed that drink then i came to know that we should not believe the advertisements ,0
but it is very different from that one in the passage ,0
they just crest impression such well that people are drag to buy it ,0
since i liked enough areas inside i bought the car a few days later ,0
exactly like master of none and jack of all ,0
the economy would benefit because this would enable it to have a worldwide compete with the car manufactures ,0
he and i are good pal but we do n t want to get a lower score than each other ,0
it is composed by not only senior but also university students ,0
one of them is the long term wastefulness of the process ,0
and if the knowledge is in all the area s then it gives you an added advantage to you knowledge level ,0
that is because if i became the member i could be highly estimate from my friends ,0
so the governments and the scientists are also promoting the less use of private cars as they are one of the greatest attributes to the air pollution ,0
people use the public water to drink water ,0
that will never cause the economic problem ,0
because this is not very easy to use ,0
but in my opinion if you want be a successful people you should have brave to try new things and take risks ,0
on the other hand scientist agree that the predators are beneficial to control the population tog the menhaden ,0
do we consider her as a smart girl ,0
for example in a chemistry class when you talk about oxygen is needed for a burning process you can give a fact to support your idea which is you can put out a fire with a blanket by cutting the oxygen ,0
every beginning has its end ,0
who we mach them together ,0
they explain the specific points using the examples about dinosaurs s behavior and physical face ,0
the lecture mentions about mongol court decors of the time ,0
it is harmful for many others animals as well as it pollutes the water sources ,0
first teacher is make a right way give to us so every teacher is make a confidence to students ,0
we do n t usually study these subject very deeply ,0
you often find people investing money in inventions only to sustain their own business ,0
for instance many people use airplane ship and train ,0
as a former law teacher at the university of belgrade i have experienced the problems students faced when taking their oral law examinations ,0
first reason students are very criticism and always have many ideas to develop her opinion ,0
they may go to the house whits the elderly person lives and help to eat food and walk ,0
there are a lot of big streets in my town ,0
the you mg passes the diseases to a couple of people here the young still enjoying life,0
it would be a really wasteful idea ,0
for example they can read again if they want and back to the page that they can not understand or they are impressed ,0
tour guides are generally trained and certified by some supervising entities therefore they are expected to be ready to provide the best possible guide to their customers ,0
however i still believe that learning facts are important for student ,0
while you will be help each other of work together after graduation from university ,0
he usually bring a book and ask something to some one he wants to understand the bud,0
operation room is not a bookmaker office or lottery house ,0
this means the more languages you know the better you can come along in other countries ,0
recently scientist have been working on new generation lie detector that can perform brain scanning to find out if person telling the true ,0
by keeping his focus on one industry and one subject he ensures that he is up to date and fully aware of all the current happenings in the industry or subject ,0
they success and they had the power ,0
it will be always pools things for them ,0
there is going to be a huge market if the product is totally brand new which is equal to a large chance to make more and lot s of money ,0
before assent like that we was all tha times under the voluntary of the man and depending economy from him ,0
when you are a teenager you start experiencing some sexual changes which in contrast changes your way of thinking thinking more about the other gender than thinking about toys would enjoy going out with some friends than staying home playing with your toys ,0
this will help them to get good marks ,0
by avoiding this it will lead to much purer and natural world for our future generations to live in ,0
in extreme cases some even gain weight because of this ,0
firstly some emergent events happening in the other countries or areas may happen in the place you live someday in future ,0
i feel that with the environmentally friendly benefits and with the attachment that society already has on cars will make people keep riding cars ,0
i do not want to go eiffel tower in paris or the statue of liberty in new york when i travel because they are too famous so i already heard and saw about them ,0
others would like to spend more time shopping than going around the places ,0
i feel this will give jobs to people also because all car companies would have to adjust with this change from gas into water fuel use ,0
as a student who learns many subjects at the same time i found it very beneficial ,0
so it is complex looking after many new employee every year can be difficult ,0
in this case the advertisement total make a impact in that baby ,0
maybe they had enjoyed life in young times too ,0
lastly business owners thought factories would help reduce their overall business expenses by reducing their transportation costs ,0
when a talk about research i mean ask people that had the product like friends family or go to forums on the internet ,0
as it is important to see your work in the context of the whole car he now still benefits from his broadly chosen majors in college ,0
successful people have to do things stable and do what they already know how to do well ,0
the students must have improved to get the correct view of the grade ,0
there are more population in every area ,0
firstly the population of the world is increasing exponentially ,0
this person guides you through paradise and takes you to wonderful places ,0
really successful people gained their fortune by doing something new something that no one else has ever done before that means that nobody knew how to do it well that was their risk ,0
and you stand nowhere in any subject ,0
this way anybody can reach success in his life and career ,0
there will be lot of members they had gone to the surface of the moon and they will be land safely to the earth ,0
now let s take the example of a millionaire who has n t managed to let go of his childish ways ,0
without facts there will be no ideas or concepts developed ,0
for example when i was freshman at meiji university in japan my classmates and i traveled for china ,0
some people dislike traveling in groups having to follow strict time schedules and following rules ,0
in this case older people can drink and can go to a lot of place such as night club bar and so on ,0
a specialist in any field will have better job opportunities of course he will not have as many opportunities but whatever it be will be far better ,0
second many of cars disadvantages will cease or decrease in the coming years which will rather make it more popular than at the current time ,0
the same will happen to taxation on cars and gasoline ,0
now a days drinking of soda became a diction to most of the people ,0
thus a series of people got together and asked guided to change the schedule and guide could not help accepting their opinions ,0
hence these advertisements may convince people that the brand being advertised is actually the best quality product when in fact it is not ,0
this economics system is the best ,0
he pointed out that climate plays a role in the erosion of materials ,0
if they are a family who likes to go places they would prefer a car against other vehicles ,0
if we have a job we like we will love to do the job no matter how the job is difficult ,0
if you want to actually know somebody you can spend the whole day with that person or place but if you do not you do not even speak to that person or even go there ,0
an 7unsuspection user cannot tell the entry has eves tampered with ,0
this is prevented if a broad choice is given ,0
usually i do n t want just myself in an unknown place ,0
i think cars will not be replaced completely by new automobile innovations but they will certainly be in fewer numbers ,0
now i am a really happy girl because i find my confidence ,0
hoes advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ,0
but in contrasting in lecture professor states that it is impossible that video is not expensive ,0
and to do that we need to move ,0
does age actually have an impact on the way you live your own life ,0
robot can work all of the days and no one is tired ,0
eventually some of them wanted to buy the product ,0
successful therapist need to know that one treatment can help one person but for another could be not appropriate ,0
in today s world we have just developed the first aspect ,0
i had lots of problem about studying science ,0
it s big importance is conscious with the bad consequences of it s decline if people continue to prefer laying down at home watching bad tv programs and other ways of easy culture maybe more attractive to them but bad for our future ,0
so we are more successful the day of the exam ,0
professor need them to do a project ,0
and when you order a big mac and see the size of it its nothing compared to what you saw in the commercial i feel like thoroughgoing it at their face ,0
but i can not use only my own subject to design a building ,0
al tough life is never easy the age do n t depend on when you can be protected or prevented from bad things ,0
if not we do not need to start its procedure ,0
it called ballast water ,0
there are many people like me then fashion market will become develop ,0
the student must be capable of understanding ideas and concepts and at the same time knowing the way how they must be developed ,0
we are also able to deal the probes found with it ,0
second there is evidence that associates the sphinx with a known old kingdom king ,0
the companies want to show there product as the best one in the competitive market and in this race they generally mislead the consumer ,0
first of all the lecture thinks that take the gas tax to reduce the number of gas consumers is not good for economics ,0
but if he did one machine like that if he want he can do another different but he does n t think that because he does n t know his own abilities ,0
and i think that young people were more politically engaged in previous times ,0
but as we are young our body generates the new cell ,0
it is a brilliant idea and you know that you are really good working with small boys and girls but you have to risk your work your salary and with this almost your life for an idea that may or may not work ,0
it s modern life now ,0
briefly sharing the cost of vexation trip is very good advantage for travel ,0
there are youths who acquire immense pleasure and self satisfaction by helping in community works ,0
in order to get an certification many wood companies around the world have introduced new ecologically friendly practices ,0
for example you were working like broadcaster but in the office and city where you are working ,0
she know just that what teacher has told her but no more ,0
when i have been to europe by using this i can save lots of money ,0
the last one is the proposed limit on menhadenhresting could mean the reduction of hut his problem is not just in menhaden but also in seville countries ,0
if the status of cars is still at the present level something else of course will take the place of cars in our lives but history tell us that advancement will never stop ,0
on admission to the university the subject breaks down i very many subjects ,0
they would use bicycles due to the relatively cheap cost and minimal need for maintenance ,0
it will also bi unfair because it would affect low income americans much nor seriously than well to do american in the listening part the woman ecplani she nor reality the raising gasoline tax dose not realest the real economic damage ,0
but this is not the situation for the old people ,0
this might contribute to a decreasing number of cars especially in developed countries like we found them in europe for example ,0
people who are trying to get into good university study by themselves everyday while i play around without reviewing and studying ,0
but that is a different situation because at this stage the graduate will have already guaranteed his her bachelors degree ,0
when facing such challenges only those who are perseverance determined and always strive until the last minute despite of the risks can finally be successful ,0
i was so mad at the tour so since then i like to travel by myself or without tour ,0
you can benefit from this knowledge in many situations ,0
but they are not examples for the whole raspsquo raspsquo young people community ,0
and governments will not provide a good public transportation system for a many years later ,0
people are not dependent of other people or timescales of for example trains trams and buses ,0
1 7 5 0 people survey to require all class and selective class ,0
for example nobody is going to ask his personal doctor which he sees when he has a flue if he can also do a heart surgery or transplant organs ,0
as a young person you can do some high risk sports like climbing a mountain for example that would be too hard to an old person do ,0
we cant stay on the internet for long time ,0
they bring us to far places in quite a fast speed without much human physical exertion ,0
and people can not ready to pay the taxes ,0
further more by these evidence u will agree,0
we gone to the pink s hot dog ,0
in old times the families tend to live in the same place for ages ,0
however many companies joined them and also sell textiles ,0
and details is the key element here esp in the academic domain ,0
for example my parents went to a group tour to my country in korea last summer ,0
by this you can learn gain the knowledge ,0
people are not and shouldn t be robots ,0
i think that young people is not able to think deeply for the things than older people ,0
cars became an important thing in our life ,0
my friends is the celebrate the pray ,0
i was upset and depressed ,0
for instance when i was a university student i researched and reported about a community history in groups ,0
thus most of the habitat in the rural eras are the old ones ,0
this is very positive for the company and probably he will get a better potion ,0
while air travel has increased in recent years there has been no decrease in car travel or car sales ,0
the product is always presented in a perfect way ,0
on one hand you have the general practitioners who look at all the basic problems related to the body while on the other hand you have the specialists who only take care of specific areas whether it be an orthopedic surgeon related to bones a cardiologist related to heart or an ent ear nose throat surgeon ,0
the deification yong or older is not apparent ,0
every knowledge is connected each other ,0
first the hunter is the most dengres things in this world for the bird ,0
hence in twenty years the need for man to go out and get what he wants will be out of question ,0
thus in my view the points made in the lecture surely challenges the specific details or the points made in the reading passage more effectively ,0
that is to say not all the old things lead to the failure ,0
the reason these problem occurs is also because of the exam ,0
what would be its environmental impact ,0
this point affect the environment of the world in case of wasting the energy ,0
if he satisfied his situation and did not make efforts to overcome himself not only he could be remembers as a great artist but we also never meet many great music ,0
he may fell afraid or terrible when the same thing happened to him ,0
some people might bring good plan to you ,0
when older people think like that it s make big problem with yong people ,0
many scientists searched the area but they ca n t find particles ,0
the question which is more important making students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts can be answered based on the level of learning which the student is undertaking ,0
some people said that placebo is really drug about 3 0 percent of patients agree with this idea ,0
because they can get a great amount of money from these companies ,0
the so delicious golden fries seen on television might actually be pale potato stumps fried to almost perfection in very very very old oil ,0
therefore the government in america should decide to raise the gasoline tax is proposed ,0
it will eat insects or animals that will did damage to places so that it can avoid loses to repair things ,0
parents have now less time to bring up their children grandparents might therefore help them more often ,0
